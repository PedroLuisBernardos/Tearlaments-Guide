| Purrely</br>Rescue-ACE</br>Drytron</br>Floowandereeze</br>Dino | ![Relinquished Anima](/cards/anima.jpg) | Arrow TOP. 1 Level 1 monster, except a Token. You can target 1 face-up monster this card points to; equip that face-up monster to this card (max. 1). You can only use this effect of "Relinquished Anima" once per turn. This card gains ATK equal to that equipped monster's. | Many decks that play lvl1 monsters will run this. Don't put any imoprtant monster under the Extra Monster zones. I've already made the misstake. Don't forget that if you pop that monster in the backrow, it's GY effects will trigger.
