## 📝 Little note before you start reading

All the info you will find here is the result of all my research and testing with this deck. Don’t take everything you will read as the absolute truth, but I do believe that most of what is said here is a great start to learn and understand this deck.

## Why play Tearlaments?

You will enjoy playing Tearlaments if you want to play a strong Tier 2 **WATER/DARK Aqua Non-Linear Tool-Box deck**. Given that almost all the cards in the deck are limited, you will need to improvise a lot and play around your own mills and hands. Your end-boards will always vary depending on the cards you see in your rotation and in the version you are playing. This deck can also be considered as a semi-back-row deck because how strong its Traps are and are always present in your board. In conclusion, you will be always changing your final board depending on the version, on your hand/mills and on your opponent’s deck. This gives a lot of flexibility and complexity to the deck.

## Tearlaments core cards breakdown

## 🧜‍♀️ The Tear girls

Each girl will allow you to make a fusion using themselves and another card in your hand, field or GY. This is the main idea of this deck: `You can Fusion Summon 1 Fusion Monster from your Extra Deck, by placing Fusion Materials mentioned on it from your hand, field, and/or GY, including this card from your GY, on the bottom of the Deck in any order.` Don’t forget that all the girls are once per turn. So, maximum 3 fusions each turn! This will be easy to remember because they are all limited, but always keep it in mind.

## Merrli

>If this card is Normal or Special Summoned: You can send the top 3 cards of your Deck to the GY. If this card is sent to the GY by card effect (except during the Damage Step): You can Fusion Summon 1 Fusion Monster from your Extra Deck, by placing Fusion Materials mentioned on it from your hand, field, and/or GY, including this card from your GY, on the bottom of the Deck in any order. You can only use each effect of "Tearlaments Merrli" once per turn.

Merrli is an okay Normal Summon that will mill you three cards. She is also a Level 2 monster, so you can pitch her with Spright Sprind. If you are asking how to make Sprind without using her, it's using a Link 2 or even Diviner.

## Havnis

>When your opponent activates a monster effect on the field (Quick Effect): You can Special Summon this card from your hand, and if you do, send the top 3 cards of your Deck to the GY. If this card is sent to the GY by card effect (except during the Damage Step): You can Fusion Summon 1 Fusion Monster from your Extra Deck, by placing Fusion Materials mentioned on it from your hand, field, and/or GY, including this card from your GY, on the bottom of the Deck in any order. You can only use each effect of "Tearlaments Havnis" once per turn.

A great Hand Trap that allows turn 0 plays and mill 3. Also, your opponent can't stop the mill once the effect has resolved; the Summon and the mill trigger on the same effect.

## Scheiren

>During your Main Phase: You can Special Summon this card from your hand, and if you do, send 1 monster from your hand to the GY, then, send the top 3 cards of your Deck to the GY. If this card is sent to the GY by card effect (except during the Damage Step): You can Fusion Summon 1 Fusion Monster from your Extra Deck, by placing Fusion Materials mentioned on it from your hand, field, and/or GY, including this card from your GY, on the bottom of the Deck in any order. You can only use each effect of "Tearlaments Scheiren" once per turn.

The best of the sisters. She will not only mill 3 but also send another monster in your hand by effect, so it will activate it's effects when send to the GY. You can also pitch a brick like Malicious or a Shuffler. Finally, your opponent can't stop the mill once the effect has resolved; the Summon and the mill trigger on the same effect.

One interesting play that you can do with Scheiren and TKash if you don't have any other monsters in hand is to activate the effect of Scheiren (cl1) and then TKash (cl2). First you will banish something to Summon TKash. Then, Scheiren checks if you have a monster on activation (so it was ok when you activated it, you had TKash), but now, since you have no monsters in hand, Scheiren will just Summon and will not mill since you can't discard any monster. This interaction is due to the **then** in this sentence: `Special Summon this card from your hand, and if you do, send 1 monster from your hand to the GY, then, send the top 3 cards of your Deck to the GY`

## 🧜‍♂️ The other Tear monsters

## Reino

>If this card is Normal or Special Summoned: You can send 1 "Tearlaments" monster from your Deck to the GY, except "Tearlaments Reinoheart". If this card is sent to the GY by card effect: You can Special Summon this card (but banish it when it leaves the field), and if you do, send 1 "Tearlaments" monster from your hand to the GY. You can only use each effect of "Tearlaments Reinoheart" once per turn.

A great Normal Summon that can pitch a girl or for TKash if you have nothing else to send. He can revive when he's milled (and be banished after), this lines comes up a lot when you are trying to make Rank 4 plays.

**Free Reino revive without discarding:** Reino only checkes if you have Tear cards to discard on activation. If on resolution you don't have any Tear card to discard, the effect will still resolve. So, for example, you mill Reino, you only have a TKash as your only Tearlaments card in hand. You can CL1 Reino, CL2 TKash. TKash will be Summoned first, then Reino. If you dont have any other Tearlaments cards in hand, you will not need to discard anything because of Reino. He only checks if you have something to discard on activation. Be careful in the case you only have TKash in hand, and you mill for example Reino and Sulliek. If you do CL1 Reino, CL2 Sulliek and CL3 TKash. You will need to discard the card searched by Sulliek because when Reino arrives on the field you have a Tear card to discard.

**Avoid Reino banish:** if you use Reino effect to revive, he will Normally be banished when he leaves the battlefield: `If this card is sent to the GY by card effect: You can Special Summon this card (but banish it when it leaves the field).` But, if you use him for a Rank 4 play, he will not be banished.

**Reino or Diviner? Which one to Summon?** Always Normal Reino. Even if he is negated, you will have a Tear name to activate your Spell/Traps and he is a Level 4 for your Xyzs. You would like to make Diviner when you can for example go for a Sprind play.

## Which girl to send?

First, you never want to send Scheiren because you want to activate her effect by using Redoer. Then, if you are asking yourself who to send with Reino, the answer is quite simple in general: send Merrli if you don't play or don't think you'll need to make Sprind during that turn. If you want to make it, send Havnis.

## TKash

>During the Main Phase (Quick Effect): You can Special Summon this card from your hand, and if you do, banish 1 "Kashtira" or "Tearlaments" card from your hand or GY. If this card is Normal or Special Summoned: You can send the top 3 cards of either player's Deck to the GY. If this card is sent to the GY by card effect: You can send the top 2 cards of your Deck to the GY. You can only use each effect of "Tearlaments Kashtira" once per turn.

Havnis 2.0. TKash allows turn 0 plays and is great to give consistency to this deck: you will mill on Summon and when sent to GY. It is also searchable with Fenrir. The only problem is that is not an Aqua nor a DARK monster.

Always banish a Trap as soon as possible with TKash if you are playing Grief: if you banish a Trap with TKash and you mill Grief, that Trap will return to your hand: `If this card [Grief] is sent to the GY by card effect: You can target 1 of your banished "Tearlaments" Traps; add it to your hand.`

Please read TKash and don't give information to your opponent for free. TKash banishes a card **if it is Summoned**. You don't need to banish when you activate its effect in your hand; so don't give information for free.

If you expect your opponent is playing Aussa the Earth Charmer, Immovable; banish Fenrir with TKash. You don't want to give your opponent a free Fenrir.

## 🪤 The Tear Spells/Traps

## Primeval Planet Perlereino

>When this card is activated: You can add 1 "Tearlaments" monster or 1 "Visas Starfrost" from your Deck to your hand. Fusion Monsters and "Tearlaments" monsters you control gain 500 ATK. If a "Tearlaments" monster(s) you control or in your GY is shuffled into the Deck or Extra Deck (except during the Damage Step): You can target 1 card on the field; destroy it. You can only use this effect of "Primeval Planet Perlereino" once per turn. You can only activate 1 "Primeval Planet Perlereino" per turn.

Perlereino is one of the best cards in this deck. It gives your Tear AND Fusion monsters an ATK boost, it searches when you activate it and can pop one card each turn. Your principal search target will be Scheiren but sometimes it will be better to search for Reino or even TKash.

## Tearlaments Scream

>If a monster(s) is Normal or Special Summoned, and you control a "Tearlaments" monster or "Visas Starfrost" (except during the Damage Step): You can send the top 3 cards of your Deck to the GY, also, for the rest of this turn, all monsters your opponent controls lose 500 ATK. If this card is sent to the GY by card effect: You can add 1 "Tearlaments" Trap from your Deck to your hand. You can only use each effect of "Tearlaments Scream" once per turn.

Scream will help a lot with the consistency of your deck. It will allow you to mill 3 cards each turn. You will also use it as your principal chainblocker for your Normal Summons. You always want to see it, and even if you mill it, you are still gaining some advantages. The ATK modifier is also very relevant in lots of cases.

A little tip I can give you is that sometimes is better to keep Scream in hand when you have Scheiren. Let's say you have Mudora, Scheiren, Scream and two other cards in hand. You have two choices here:

* Activate Scream. Then, activate Scheiren. You will mill 6. **But**, if you mill Reino, you will not be able to Special Summon him.
* Activate Scheiren. You mill 3. **You hit Reino**. So you activate his effect by pitching Scream, and continue.

In general, in this situation, I think that if you can play without that Reino, just go and activate Scream. But if Reino is really important, keep it. If for example, you had an Agido instead of the Mudora, because you will mill 8 instead of 3, I would have kept the Scream in hand.

## Tearlaments Grief

>Special Summon 1 "Tearlaments" monster or "Visas Starfrost" from your Deck or GY, then send 1 monster you control to the GY, with the same Type or Attribute as that Special Summoned monster. If this card is sent to the GY by card effect: You can target 1 of your banished "Tearlaments" Traps; add it to your hand. You can only use 1 "Tearlaments Grief" effect per turn, and only once that turn.

Grief is a Monster Reborn or a Foolish Burial in one card. It seems pretty great, but the problem is that you need to send one card with the same type or attribute from the tutored card, so in general you will send the same card you selected. It is also a good card to send to the GY, specially after banishing a Trap with TKash.

A little tip if you really want to mill and have already a Reino: you can Summon TKash with Grief and then send Reino to GY since they are both WATER.

Another nice interaction is to Special Summon Merrli and send form the field Havnis or Scheiren. Then you cl1 Merrli and cl2 the other girl to mill 3 then fuse.

## Tearlaments Heartbeat

>Target 1 Spell/Trap on the field, ~~or you can target 2 if you control "Visas Starfrost"~~; shuffle them into the Deck, then send 1 card from your hand to the GY. If this card is sent to the GY by card effect: You can target 1 "Tearlaments" Trap in your GY; add it to your hand. You can only use 1 "Tearlaments Heartbeat" effect per turn, and only once that turn.

Heartbeat is a Spell/Trap removal that discards a card as effect (so it will trigger in the GY). What I really like about this, is that you shuffle back the card, so you don't give advantage to your opponent by sending it GY for example.

## Tearlaments Sulliek

>If you control a "Tearlaments" monster or "Visas Starfrost": You can target 1 Effect Monster your opponent controls; negate its effects, then send 1 monster you control to the GY. If this card is sent to the GY by card effect: You can add 1 "Tearlaments" monster from your Deck to your hand. You can only use each effect of "Tearlaments Sulliek" once per turn.

Probably the best Trap this deck could have; Sulliek **permanently** negates one Monster each turn, and sends your Tear monsters to the GY to activate its effect. Additionally, it tutors a Monster when sent to the GY.

## Tearlaments Metanoise

>If you control a "Tearlaments" monster or "Visas Starfrost": Target 1 face-up monster your opponent controls; change it to face-down Defense Position, then send 1 "Tearlaments" monster from your Deck to the GY. If this card is sent to the GY by card effect: You can target 1 "Tearlaments" monster in your GY; add it to your hand. You can only use 1 "Tearlaments Metanoise" effect per turn, and only once that turn.

Book of Moon + Foolish Burial + Monster Reincarnation when sent to the GY. This card is great to stop your opponent from going into Synchro, Xyz and Link plays (they will still be able to fuse using the face-down monster).

## Tearlaments Cryme

>When a Spell/Trap Card, or monster effect, is activated, while you control a "Tearlaments" monster or "Visas Starfrost": Negate the activation, and if you do, shuffle that card into the Deck, then send 1 monster from your hand to the GY. If this card is sent to the GY by card effect: You can target 1 of your banished "Tearlaments" monsters; add it to your hand. You can only use 1 "Tearlaments Cryme" effect per turn, and only once that turn.

Cryme is an omni-negate with counter-trap speed (so your opponent can only chain to this activation with other counter-traps only) that discards a card as effect (so it will trigger in the GY). This trap can also recycle your banished Tear names (for example if you are playing against Bystials or your Runick opponent was lucky). Normally, you want to search this with Kaleido-Heart on turn 1 and set it.

## 👹 The Extra-deck monsters

## Tearlaments Kaleido-Heart

>"Tearlaments Reinoheart" + 2 Aqua monsters. Cannot be used as Fusion Material. If this card is Special Summoned, or if an Aqua monster is sent to your GY by card effect while this card is on the field: You can target 1 card your opponent controls; shuffle it into the Deck. If this card is sent to the GY by card effect: You can Special Summon this card, and if you do, send 1 "Tearlaments" card from your Deck to the GY. You can only use each effect of "Tearlaments Kaleido-Heart" once per turn.

The most terrifying monster to play against. Kaleido can spin any card on Summon or when he revives and can also send any Tear card from your deck to your GY. You can for example make Kaleido during your turn, kill it with Perlereino, then revive it and send Scream or Sulliek to have access to any card in your deck.

Don't forget that you can make it with any Aqua monster (like Toad or Gameciel). Also, you can make it with two Kings; one being Reino and the other the Aqua monster.

Finally, don't forget no one can fuse with it. So if your opponent plays Fallen of Albaz or Super Poly they will not able to remove it. The same is for you, if you want to spin it back to the extra deck, you'll need a Shuffler or Metanoise.

## Tearlaments Rulkallos

>~~"Tearlaments Kitkallos"~~ "King of the Swamp" + 1 "Tearlaments" monster. Other Aqua monsters you control cannot be destroyed by battle. You can only use each of the following effects of "Tearlaments Rulkallos" once per turn. When your opponent activates a card or effect that includes an effect that Special Summons a monster(s) (Quick Effect): You can negate the activation, and if you do, destroy it, then, send 1 "Tearlaments" card from your hand or face-up field to the GY. If this Fusion Summoned card is sent to the GY by a card effect: You can Special Summon this card.

Rulkallos has an included Solemn Warning that makes her terrifing. She can also revive (only once). This can be pretty useful to pitch your Sulliek for example to search for TKash or even Havnis to have an extra interaction during your opponent's turn. It can also protect your Aqua monsters like Toad, the girls or even a Gameciel your opponent gave you.

## Grapha, Dragon Overlord of Dark World

>~~"Grapha, Dragon Lord of Dark World"~~ "King of the Swamp" + 1 DARK monster. When your opponent activates a monster effect, or a Normal Spell/Trap Card, while you have a card(s) in your hand (Quick Effect): You can activate this effect; the activated effect becomes "Your opponent discards 1 card". You can only use this effect of "Grapha, Dragon Overlord of Dark World" once per turn. ~~If this Fusion Summoned card in its owner's control leaves the field because of an opponent's card: You can Special Summon 1 of your "Grapha, Dragon Lord of Dark World" that is banished or in your GY, then each player with a hand discards 1 card.~~

Grapha only checks if you have cards to discard on activation. If on resolution you don't have anything, the effect will still resolve. For example, lets say your hand is only TKash. You can CL1 Grapha, CL2 TKash. TKash will be Summoned and Grapha will not discard anything because on activation you respected the conditions.

In the Dark World matchup, you can use their Grapha and one of your DARK monsters to make big Grapaha with Super Poly.

## Which one to make? Rulkallos or Grapaha?

Normally, Grapha is better: it is bigger and can negate more things. It also triggers the card you will discard. But, in some cases you will need to do Rulkallos:

* If you will not have a card to discard with Grapha.
* If you have Heartbeat and/or Cryme, and don't have enough cards to discard.
* If you have one of the Spell/Traps that need a Tear name and you don't have a name in board (or Havnis/TKash in hand).
* If you know Rulkallos will be enough and you will gain more advantage of its revive.
* If you need to protect your other Aqua monsters (specially Toad).

## Mudragon of the Swamp

>2 monsters with the same Attribute but different Types. Your opponent cannot target this card, or monsters on the field with the same Attribute as this card, with card effects. Once per turn (Quick Effect): You can declare 1 Attribute; this card becomes that Attribute until the end of this turn.

Mostly a Super Poly target, but can also help to protect your DARK monsters or even make Toad with Reino.

## Garura, Wings of Resonant Life

>2 monsters with the same Type and Attribute, but different names. Any battle damage your opponent takes from battles involving this card is doubled. If this card is sent to the GY: You can draw 1 card. You can only use this effect of "Garura, Wings of Resonant Life" once per turn.

This is mostly a Super Poly target. Can also help in very niche circumstance to make Beatrice. Don't forget that when it attacks the opponent it has doubled attack (Perlereino, Wraitsoth and Cross-Sheep modify it).

## Predaplant Dragostapelia

>1 Fusion Monster + 1 DARK monster. Once per turn (Quick Effect): You can target 1 face-up monster your opponent controls; place 1 Predator Counter on it, and if it is Level 2 or higher, it becomes Level 1 as long as it has a Predator Counter. Negate the activated effects of your opponent's monsters that have Predator Counters.

Another Super Poly target, but can also be made to kill Xyz or Spright decks by changing the monster's Level. Don't forget that when Dragostapelia will leave the field the monster will not be negated anymore, but it's Level will still be 1.

## Guardian Chimera

>3 monsters with different names. Must first be Fusion Summoned using only Fusion Materials from your hand and field, with at least 1 monster from each. If this card is Fusion Summoned by a Spell Card or effect: You can draw cards equal to the number of cards used as material from the hand, and if you do, destroy cards your opponent controls equal to the number of cards used as material from the field. You can only use this effect of "Guardian Chimera" once per turn. While "Polymerization" is in your GY, your opponent cannot target this card with card effects.

Principally here to unbrick you when you go first, or to make you win when you are going second. It is also bigger than Grapha and untargetable when Poly is in the GY.

## Time Thief Redoer

>2 Level 4 monsters. Once per turn, during the Standby Phase: You can attach the top card of your opponent's Deck to this card as material. (Quick Effect): You can detach up to 3 different types of materials from this card, then apply the following effect(s) depending on what was detached. ● Monster: Banish this card until the End Phase. ● Spell: Draw 1 card. ● Trap: Place 1 face-up card your opponent controls on the top of the Deck. You can only use this effect of "Time Thief Redoer" once per turn.

Your best Rank 4 monster that will trigger Shreiren fusion (because it sends as an effect). You can steal important combo pieces from your opponent's deck, and can trigger Scheiren during your opponent's turn.

**Don't steal your opponent's cards. Always check before pickup up your cards.**

## Baronne de Fleur

>10 stars. 1 Tuner + 1+ non-Tuner monsters. Once per turn: You can target 1 card on the field; destroy it. Once while face-up on the field, when a card or effect is activated (Quick Effect): You can negate the activation, and if you do, destroy that card. You can only use the previous effect of "Baronne de Fleur" once per turn. Once per turn, during the Standby Phase: You can target 1 Level 9 or lower monster in your GY; return this card to the Extra Deck, and if you do, Special Summon that monster.

Incredible omni-negate that can pop your own cards to extend your plays. Also, once you have used your omni, you can revive any important monster in your GY (except Grapha) to continue your plays.

## Perlereino/Baronne pop your own cards

During your turn, you can always pop your own cards to maximize your effects.

The easiest card to pop is Kaleido-Heart, because he will then return and mill a Tear card. Normally you will send Scream, to search for any Trap in your deck.

Be careful if you just summoned Kaleido under Cross-Sheep and want to pop it. You **need** to chain Cross-Sheep on cl2 and Perlereino on cl1 because if you don't, Kaleido will not be there when Cross-Sheep will check if there is a monster under its arrow.

## 👑 The rest

## Mudora the Sword Oracle

>You can discard 1 other EARTH Fairy monster; Special Summon this card from your hand, ~~then you can place 1 "Gravekeeper's Trap" from your Deck face-up in your Spell & Trap Zone.~~ (Quick Effect): You can banish this card from your field or GY, then target up to 3 cards in any GY(s), ~~or up to 5 if "Exchange of the Spirit" is on your field or in your GY~~; shuffle them into the Deck. You can only use each effect of "Mudora the Sword Oracle" once per turn.

The worst of the Shufflers. Mudora is good to discard your Millers and to shuffle back cards from the GY.

## Keldo the Sacred Protector

>You can discard 1 other EARTH Fairy monster; Special Summon this card from your hand, then add ~~1 "Exchange of the Spirit" or~~ 1 card that mentions it from your Deck to your hand. (Quick Effect): You can banish this card from your field or GY, then target up to 3 cards in any GY(s), ~~or up to 5 if "Exchange of the Spirit" is on your field or in your GY~~; shuffle them into the Deck. You can only use each effect of "Keldo the Sacred Protector" once per turn.

Keldo is like a better Mudora. When you activate it's effect in hand you need (mandatory) to search for another Ishizu monster; I would recommend to get Kelbek for another interaction.

## If you use your Shufflers try to go to 3 cards even if you have nothing to select

Let's say for example that you want to shuffle back your Reino in your GY (and nothing else), and your opponent has nothing good in his GY. You can always shuffle back useless cards to hurt the consistency of their deck.

## Agido the Ancient Sentinel

>If a card(s) is sent from the hand or Deck to your opponent's GY (except during the Damage Step): You can Special Summon this card from your hand, then you can Special Summon 1 Level 4 EARTH Fairy monster from your GY, except "Agido the Ancient Sentinel". If this card is sent from the hand or Deck to the GY: You can activate this effect; each player sends the top 5 cards of their Deck to the GY (or their entire Deck, if less than 5), ~~then, if "Exchange of the Spirit" is in your GY, you can send 5 more cards from the top of either player's Deck to the GY~~. You can only use each effect of "Agido the Ancient Sentinel" once per turn.

The worst of the Millers. It can monster reborn another Ishizu to make Rank 4 plays, but it's mostly useful when sent to the GY to mill 5.

## Kelbek the Ancient Vanguard

>If a card(s) is sent from the hand or Deck to your opponent's GY (except during the Damage Step): You can target 1 Special Summoned monster your opponent controls; Special Summon this card from your hand, then return that monster to the hand. If this card is sent from the hand or Deck to the GY: You can activate this effect; each player sends the top 5 cards of their Deck to the GY (or their entire Deck, if less than 5), ~~then, if "Exchange of the Spirit" is in your GY, you can Set 1 Trap from your GY~~. You can only use each effect of "Kelbek the Ancient Vanguard" once per turn.

Kelbek has a crazy effect in hand and when sent to the GY. It is clearly the best of the Ishizu cards. Use it wisely, sometimes it's better to return a monster to the hand to interrupt your opponent's plays instead of milling 5.

## Your Millers will trigger even if they are discarded as cost

The cards say: `If this card is sent from the hand or Deck to the GY`. So if you respect this condition, even if you discarded as cost (like by using Super Poly), they will mill 5.

## Your Millers' effect on the GY will trigger the effect of the other Miller in hand

Since, you force your opponent to send a card from his deck to the GY and your Millers say: `If a card(s) is sent from the hand or Deck to your opponent's GY (except during the Damage Step)`, once you activate for example Agido, you would be able to chain Kelbek in hand.

## King of the Swamp

>This card can be used as a substitute for any 1 Fusion Material whose name is specifically listed on the Fusion Monster Card, but the other Fusion Material(s) must be correct. You can discard this card to the Graveyard; add 1 "Polymerization" from your Deck to your hand.

Used to tutor for Poly and have access to your strong fusions.

## Trivikarma

>~~Target 1 "Visas Starfrost" in your Monster Zone and 1 Effect Monster your opponent controls; negate that opponent's monster's effects, and if you do, your targeted monster gains ATK equal to half of that monster's original ATK or DEF (whichever is higher).~~ You can banish this card from your GY; add 1 Spell/Trap that mentions "Visas Starfrost" from your Deck to your hand, except "Trivikarma". You can only use 1 "Trivikarma" effect per turn, and only once that turn.

This allows you to shuffle back your deck when you want to remove your girls from the bottom, and also, searches almost any Spell/Trap you need. You will never use the first effect, unless you play Visas, so this card is a brick in hand (but there are many ways to discard it).

## Shuffle your deck when your girls are in the bottom

Wait until your names are in the bottom to shuffle your deck. You have many ways to shuffle it: Malicious, King of the Swamp, Beatrice, Shufflers, Trivikarma, Reino, Terraforming, Foolish, Foolish Goods... This is mostly important when you make Garura with two girls or when you make two fusions back-to-back. You need to put the girls back in any order in your deck; if they are in the bottom you know you will never see them anymore.

## 🌶️ Mainboard spicy cards

This list will include the non-core cards you can consider to your deckbuilding. See the full list here: [https://pedroluisbernardos.github.io/Tearlaments-Guide/#the-spice-list](https://pedroluisbernardos.github.io/Tearlaments-Guide/#the-spice-list)

## 🙃 Sideboard

This list will include many cards to consider for your sideboard. See the full list here: [https://pedroluisbernardos.github.io/Tearlaments-Guide/#sideboard](https://pedroluisbernardos.github.io/Tearlaments-Guide/#sideboard)

## Sideboard cards in your mainboard

In your mainboard I would recommend to have 3 to 6 cards going second. You can consider for example, Kaijus, Super Poly, TTT, Books, etc.

## Sideboard cards in your sideboard

Counting the ones you have in your mainboard:

* 3 cards against towers (Super Poly or Kaijus).
* 2-3 back-row hate (Harpie's, Hearbeat, Shaddoll Dragon, Cosmic Cyclone, Twin Twisters, etc.).
* Graveyard hate is useful, but since we are playing Abyss Dweller as a core card, this is not mandatory. You can also consider 2-3 cards (Called by, Belles, Bystials, D.D. Crows).
* Cryme is good to have. It's a great going first card and can be searchable with Kaleido.
* If you are competitive, you'll need time cards (Gagaga Cowboy, Ladybug or Scattershot (if playing Sprind)). Some archetypes have their own in-time cards, like Ancient Fairy Dragon.

## Good targets to side out

Best cards to side out are cards that are dead in the matchup or flexible cards.

## Going first

* You can side out your main deck going second cards
   * Super Poly
   * Kaijus (if you are playing Toad, consider on maybe keeping one Radian to make the toad)
* If you still need room, you can side out some flex cards such as
   * Terraforming
   * Foolish Burial Goods
   * Scream (keep at least 2).
   * Fenrir/Diviner (keep at least 1 main board)
   * Wraitsoth

## Going second

* You can side out your Traps (keep 1 Sulliek)
* Scream (keep at least 1)
* Terraforming
* Foolish Burial Goods
* Diviner (keep at least 1)
* Wraitsoth

## For the cards that depend on the matchup

Here are some examples:

* If you are playing against Floo, side out all your Shaddoll cards and Mudora.
* If you are playing against a deck that doesn't need that much his GY like Kashtira, side out Mudora.
* If you are playing against a deck that will have floodgates, keep Fenrir and Wraitsoth; Fenrir will help you cleaning them.

## Dracossack - Cherubini - Sprind

With only Fenrir and a card to Special Summon TKash, you are able to send King of the Swamp and Merrli to the GY. Any other card you mill or you have in hand, are extenders.

## Example of endboard with Beatrice and Winda

Ideally it can be bigger depending on your mills but the objective is simple: pitch Beast in your turn and make Winda in your opponent's turn.

## Example of endboard with Cross-Sheep and Redoer

On your opponent's turn, you can fuse (with Scheiren). Put the fusion under Cross-Sheep. Then activate Sheep effect: revive Reino and continue...

## Revolution combo

If you are playing the Revolution version, you can make a big board using only Fenrir and Revolution Synchron. In this case I was very lucky with all my follow-up and cards, but even without that Scheiren in hand I guarantee myself a Baronne and a mill 5 with TKash.

## Shaddoll combo

The general idea is to take Schism with Apkallone and make the most useful fusion during your opponent's turn.

## Shaddoll combo, how to make Baronne

The general idea is to use Cross-Shepp to revive Falco or Diviner, then make Baronne by using Construct or Granguignol.

## Destrudo combo

So, you normally want a Level 4 and a Level 7 on board. You target the Level 4 monster and Summon Destrudo as a Level 3. Then you make Baronne. If you are playing Synchro 7 monsters you can also target any Level 1-6 monster with Destrudo and Synchro Summon right away. For example:

* Target a Level 2 -> Destrudo becomes a Level 5 -> 2 + 5 = 7
* ...
* Target a Level 6 -> Destrudo becomes a Level 1 -> 6 + 1 = 7

## 🤳 Test hands (videos)

## 1. Opponent Ashes my Fenrir

In this example, I have two choices:

* I keep Fenrir, set Book of Moon and pass.
* I gamble and make Guardian Chimera to mill 2 and draw 1 (in this case, it wasn't very good).

[https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=1000060-52665159](https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=1000060-52665159)

## 2. Opponent Ashes my Scheiren

In this example I was lucky and had Poly, so I could make Guardian Chimera and continue. I also gambled when I chained CL1 Scheiren and CL2 Agido; if I would have hit nothing, I would have been obligated to fuse Scheiren + Guardian Chimera into Dragostapelia. Luckily I hit a King of the Swamp. Also, I decided to make Grapha to get rid of my Trivikarma in hand, and also, I knew that I will have a Tear name online because I milled Sulliek (so I searched for TKash). Finally, I decided to get Metanoise, because I prefer to pitch a girl than to randomly mill 2.

## 🔚 Example of endboard

The endboards will vary a lot depending on what you mill. Supposing your opponent has no interactions and you are going first, here are some examples of endboards you could have.

All pictures available here: [https://pedroluisbernardos.github.io/Tearlaments-Guide/#example-of-endboard](https://pedroluisbernardos.github.io/Tearlaments-Guide/#example-of-endboard)

## ⛓️ Chainblocking

## Chainblocking Belle

This also works with Skull Meister.

When you mill a girl and another card that has an effect when send to the GY (for example Shaddoll Beast), you can CL1 the girl and CL2 that other card to protect your effect that will fusion Summon from Ghost Belle.

## Chainblocking Ash

Protect your most important mill/search by putting it in CL1. For example, if you have a TKash mill and an Agido mill, put Agido in CL1 in case your opponent Ashes you because mill 5 > mill 2.

## Chain order if you know your opponent has Ash and Imperm

If for example you have Scream in play and you Normal a Reino. Normally you would do: Cl1 Reino CL2 Scream. Reino is protected from Ash which is good.

BUT, imagine the scenario where they have Imperm too: Ash will negate Scream and Imperm will negate Reino. In this case, it's better to chainblock Scream with Reino, so Ash and Imperm can only negate him and Scream will resolve.

## ❌ Cards against Tear

The full description on how to use those cards (as the player against Tear) and how to beat them (as the Tear player) will be available here: [https://pedroluisbernardos.github.io/Tearlaments-Guide/#cards-against-tear](https://pedroluisbernardos.github.io/Tearlaments-Guide/#cards-against-tear) There are also some tips and tricks to know.

## Cards that hurt a lot

## Other tips vs Tear

* Don't forget that they play Guardian Chimera, so be careful of the Poly in GY.
* Dont forget that Metanoise, Hearbeat, Cryme and Grief recycle cards. Expect it.
* Always think that they can make Kaleido, Dragostapelia or Mudragon quite easily. Remove the cards that allow it.
* Always pop Perlereino, it's the only card that doesn't trigger when it goes to the GY.
* If they activate the effect of one of their Spell/Traps when sent to the GY, its the time to pop their back-row!
* Scream and Perlereino only modify ATK. Wraitsoth modifies ATK and DEF.
* Keep track where the girls are after they fuse. If you know two girls are in the bottom of the deck, try to see how they can shuffle their deck and try to counter it.

## Small tips to know the Tear player's hand

* If they search Reino or TKash with Perlereino is mostly because they have Scheiren in hand.
* If they search TKash with Perlereino is mostly because they have Reino and Scheiren in hand.
* If they search TKash with Wraitsoth is because they have Fenrir in hand.
* If they pitch Kelbek with Diviner is because they have Agido in hand.
* If they pitch Merrli over Havnis is because they have Merrli in hand **or** they don't play Spright Sprind.
