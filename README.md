## Little note before you start reading

All the info you will find here is the result of all my research and testing with this deck. Don't take everything you will read as the absolute truth, but I do believe that most of what is said here is a great start to learn and understand this deck.

This is a very in depth guide, so skip any section you might already know. I have maybe added too much information, but at least I feel that everything I wanted to say is here hehe.

## Why play Tearlaments?

You will enjoy playing Tearlaments if you want to play a strong Tier-2 <strong style="color: #3b729b">Water</strong>/<strong style="color: #953291">Dark</strong> **Aqua Non-Linear Tool-Box deck**. Given that almost all the cards in the deck are limited, you will need to improvise a lot and play around your own mills and hands. Your [endboards](#example-of-endboard) will always vary depending on the cards you see in your rotation. This deck can also be considered as a semi-backrow deck because how strong its Traps are and are always present in your board. In conclusion, you will be always changing your final board depending on the version, on your hand/mills and on your opponent's deck. This gives a lot of flexibility and complexity to the deck.

## Tearlaments core cards breackdown

### The Tear girls

Each girl will allow you to make a fusion using themselves and another card in your hand, field or GY. This is the main idea of this deck: `You can Fusion Summon 1 Fusion Monster from your Extra Deck, by placing Fusion Materials mentioned on it from your hand, field, and/or GY, including this card from your GY, on the bottom of the Deck in any order.` Don't forget that all the girls are once per turn. So, maximum 3 fusions each turn! This will be easy to remember because they are all limited, but always keep it in mind.

| Quantity | Card | Effect | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | ![Tearlaments Merrli](/cards/merrli.jpg) | If this card is Normal or Special Summoned: You can send the top 3 cards of your Deck to the GY. If this card is sent to the GY by card effect (except during the Damage Step): You can Fusion Summon 1 Fusion Monster from your Extra Deck, by placing Fusion Materials mentioned on it from your hand, field, and/or GY, including this card from your GY, on the bottom of the Deck in any order. You can only use each effect of "Tearlaments Merrli" once per turn. | Merrli is an okay Normal Summon that will mill you three cards. She is also a Level 2 monster, so you can pitch her with Spright Sprind. If you are asking how to make Sprind without using her, it's using a Link 2 or even Diviner: `2 monsters, including a Level/Link 2 monster.` |
| 1 | ![Tearlaments Havnis](/cards/havnis.jpg) | When your opponent activates a monster effect on the field (Quick Effect): You can Special Summon this card from your hand, and if you do, send the top 3 cards of your Deck to the GY. If this card is sent to the GY by card effect (except during the Damage Step): You can Fusion Summon 1 Fusion Monster from your Extra Deck, by placing Fusion Materials mentioned on it from your hand, field, and/or GY, including this card from your GY, on the bottom of the Deck in any order. You can only use each effect of "Tearlaments Havnis" once per turn. | A great Hand Trap that allows turn 0 plays and mill 3. Also, your opponent can't stop the mill once the effect has resolved; the Summon and the mill trigger on the same effect. |
| 1 | ![Tearlaments Sheirenm](/cards/sheiren.jpg) | During your Main Phase: You can Special Summon this card from your hand, and if you do, send 1 monster from your hand to the GY, then, send the top 3 cards of your Deck to the GY. If this card is sent to the GY by card effect (except during the Damage Step): You can Fusion Summon 1 Fusion Monster from your Extra Deck, by placing Fusion Materials mentioned on it from your hand, field, and/or GY, including this card from your GY, on the bottom of the Deck in any order. You can only use each effect of "Tearlaments Scheiren" once per turn. | The best of the sisters. She will not only mill 3 but also send another monster in your hand by effect, so it will activate it's effects when send to the GY. You can also pitch a brick like Malicious or a Shuffler. Finally, your opponent can't stop the mill once the effect has resolved; the Summon and the mill trigger on the same effect.|

### The other Tear monsters

| Quantity | Card | Effect | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2-3 | ![Tearlaments Reino-Heart](/cards/reino.jpg) | If this card is Normal or Special Summoned: You can send 1 "Tearlaments" monster from your Deck to the GY, except "Tearlaments Reinoheart". If this card is sent to the GY by card effect: You can Special Summon this card (but banish it when it leaves the field), and if you do, send 1 "Tearlaments" monster from your hand to the GY. You can only use each effect of "Tearlaments Reinoheart" once per turn. | A great Normal Summon that can pitch a girl or for TKash if you have nothing else to send. He can revive when he's milled (and be banished after), this lines comes up a lot when you are trying to make Rank 4 plays.<br /><br />__Free Reino revive without discarding:__ Reino only checkes if you have Tear cards to discard on activation. If on resolution you don't have any Tear card to discard, the effect will still resolve. So, for example, you mill Reino, you only have a TKash as your only Tearlaments card in hand. You can CL1 Reino, CL2 TKash. TKash will be Summoned first, then Reino. If you dont have any other Tearlaments cards in hand, you will not need to discard anything because of Reino. He only checks if you have something to discard on activation. Be careful in the case you only have TKash in hand, and you mill for example Reino and Sulliek. If you do CL1 Reino, CL2 Sulliek and CL3 TKash. You will need to discard the card searched by Sulliek because when Reino arrives on the field you have a Tear card to discard.<br /><br />__Avoid Reino banish:__ if you use Reino effect to revive, he will Normally be banished when he leaves the battlefield: `If this card is sent to the GY by card effect: You can Special Summon this card (but banish it when it leaves the field).` But, if you use him for a Rank 4 play, he will not be banished. |
| 3 | ![Tearlaments Kashtira](/cards/tkash.jpg) | During the Main Phase (Quick Effect): You can Special Summon this card from your hand, and if you do, banish 1 "Kashtira" or "Tearlaments" card from your hand or GY. If this card is Normal or Special Summoned: You can send the top 3 cards of either player's Deck to the GY. If this card is sent to the GY by card effect: You can send the top 2 cards of your Deck to the GY. You can only use each effect of "Tearlaments Kashtira" once per turn. | Havnis 2.0. TKash allows turn 0 plays and is great to give consistency to this deck: you will mill on Summon and when sent to GF. It is also searchable with Fenrir. The only problem is that is not an Aqua nor a Dark monster.<br /><br />Always banish a Trap as soon as possible with TKash if you are playing Grief: if you banish a Trap with TKash and you mill Grief, that Trap will return to your hand: `If this card is sent to the GY by card effect: You can target 1 of your banished "Tearlaments" Traps; add it to your hand.`<br /><br />Please read TKash and don't give information to your opponent for free. TKash banishes a card if it is Summoned. You don't need to banish when you activate its effect in your hand; so don't give information for free.<br /><br />If you expect your opponent is playing Aussa the Earth Charmer, Immovable, banish Fenrir with TKash; you don't want to give your opponent a free Fenrir.<br /><br />__Metanoise and TKash are milled:__ if you mill TKash and Metanoise, and you want to recycle your TKash. Please, put Metanoise in CL1. If you don't TKash will not be able to mill your 2 cards, because it will not be in the GY anymore.<br /><br />__Chaining TKash to Shifter:__ if you chain TKash to Shifter, your three cards will be banished, since TKash mills on Summon and not using the effect in hand. |

#### Reino or Diviner? Which one to Summon?

Always Normal Reino. Even if he is negated, you will have a Tear name to activate your Spell/Traps and he is a Level 4 for your Xyzs. you would like to make Diviner when you can for example go for a Sprind play.

#### Which girl to send?

Also, if you are asking yourself who to send with Reino, the answer is quite simple: send Merrli if you don't play or don't think you'll need to make Sprind during that turn. If you want to make it, send Havnis. This may not be true in some very nieche situations (for example, you are playing Sprind and you know your opponent has Belle, and you can make Cross-Sheep to revive Merrli and then mill 3), but in general this is the good way of thinking.

### The Tear Spell/Trap

| Quantity | Card | Effect | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | ![Primeval Planet Perlereino](/cards/perlereino.jpg) | When this card is activated: You can add 1 "Tearlaments" monster or 1 "Visas Starfrost" from your Deck to your hand. Fusion Monsters and "Tearlaments" monsters you control gain 500 ATK. If a "Tearlaments" monster(s) you control or in your GY is shuffled into the Deck or Extra Deck (except during the Damage Step): You can target 1 card on the field; destroy it. You can only use this effect of "Primeval Planet Perlereino" once per turn. You can only activate 1 "Primeval Planet Perlereino" per turn. | Perlereino is one of the best cards in this deck. It gives your Tear AND Fusion monsters an ATK boost, it searches when you activate it and can pop one card each turn. Your principal search target will be Sheiren but sometimes it will be better to search for Reino or even TKash. |
| 2-3 | ![Tearlaments Scream](/cards/scream.jpg) | If a monster(s) is Normal or Special Summoned, and you control a "Tearlaments" monster or "Visas Starfrost" (except during the Damage Step): You can send the top 3 cards of your Deck to the GY, also, for the rest of this turn, all monsters your opponent controls lose 500 ATK. If this card is sent to the GY by card effect: You can add 1 "Tearlaments" Trap from your Deck to your hand. You can only use each effect of "Tearlaments Scream" once per turn. | Scream will help a lot with the consistency of your deck. It will allow you to mill 3 cards each turn. You will also use it as your principal [chainblocker](#chainblocking) for your Normal Summons. You always want to see it, and even if you mill it, you are still gaining some advantages. The ATK modifier is also very relevant in lots of cases. |
| 0-1 | ![Tearlaments Grief](/cards/grief.jpg) | Special Summon 1 "Tearlaments" monster or "Visas Starfrost" from your Deck or GY, then send 1 monster you control to the GY, with the same Type or Attribute as that Special Summoned monster. If this card is sent to the GY by card effect: You can target 1 of your banished "Tearlaments" Traps; add it to your hand. You can only use 1 "Tearlaments Grief" effect per turn, and only once that turn. | Grief is a Monster Reborn or a Foolish Burial in one card. It seems pretty great, but the problem is that you need to send one card with the same type or attribute from the tutored card, so in general you will send the same card you selected. It is also a good card to send to the GY, specially after banishing a Trap with TKash.<br /><br />A little tip if you really want to mill and have already a Reino: you can Summon TKash with Grief and then send Reino to GY since they are both Water. |
| 0-1 Normally side | ![Tearlaments Heartbeat](/cards/heartbeat.jpg) | Target 1 Spell/Trap on the field, ~~or you can target 2 if you control "Visas Starfrost"~~; shuffle them into the Deck, then send 1 card from your hand to the GY. If this card is sent to the GY by card effect: You can target 1 "Tearlaments" Trap in your GY; add it to your hand. You can only use 1 "Tearlaments Heartbeat" effect per turn, and only once that turn. | Heartbeat is a Spell/Trap removal that discards a card as effect (so it will trigger in the GY). What I really like about this, is that you shuffle back the card, so you don't give advantage to your opponent by sending it GY for example. |
| 2-3 | ![Tearlaments Sulliek](/cards/sulliek.jpg) | If you control a "Tearlaments" monster or "Visas Starfrost": You can target 1 Effect Monster your opponent controls; negate its effects, then send 1 monster you control to the GY. If this card is sent to the GY by card effect: You can add 1 "Tearlaments" monster from your Deck to your hand. You can only use each effect of "Tearlaments Sulliek" once per turn. | Probably the best Trap this deck could have; Sulliek __permanently__ negates one Monster each turn, and sends your Tear monsters to the GY to activate its effect. Additionally, it tutors a Monster when sent to the GY. |
| 0-1 | ![Tearlaments Metanoise](/cards/metanoise.jpg) | If you control a "Tearlaments" monster or "Visas Starfrost": Target 1 face-up monster your opponent controls; change it to face-down Defense Position, then send 1 "Tearlaments" monster from your Deck to the GY. If this card is sent to the GY by card effect: You can target 1 "Tearlaments" monster in your GY; add it to your hand. You can only use 1 "Tearlaments Metanoise" effect per turn, and only once that turn. | Book of Moon + Foolish Burial + Monster Reincarnation when sent to the GY. This card is great to stop your opponent from going into Synchro, Xyz and Link plays (they will still be able to fuse using the face-down monster). |
| 0-1 Normally side | ![Tearlaments Cryme](/cards/cryme.jpg) | When a Spell/Trap Card, or monster effect, is activated, while you control a "Tearlaments" monster or "Visas Starfrost": Negate the activation, and if you do, shuffle that card into the Deck, then send 1 monster from your hand to the GY. If this card is sent to the GY by card effect: You can target 1 of your banished "Tearlaments" monsters; add it to your hand. You can only use 1 "Tearlaments Cryme" effect per turn, and only once that turn. | Cryme is an omni-negate with counter-trap speed (so your opponent can only chain to this activation with other counter-traps only) that discards a card as effect (so it will trigger in the GY). This trap can also recycle your banished Tear names (for example if you are playing against Bystials or your Runick opponent was lucky). Normally, you want to search this with Kaleido-Heart on turn 1 and set it. |

### The Extra-deck monsters

| Quantity | Card | Effect | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | ![Tearlaments Rullkallos](/cards/rullkallos.jpg) | ~~"Tearlaments Kitkallos"~~ "King of the Swamp" + 1 "Tearlaments" monster. Other Aqua monsters you control cannot be destroyed by battle. You can only use each of the following effects of "Tearlaments Rulkallos" once per turn. When your opponent activates a card or effect that includes an effect that Special Summons a monster(s) (Quick Effect): You can negate the activation, and if you do, destroy it, then, send 1 "Tearlaments" card from your hand or face-up field to the GY. If this Fusion Summoned card is sent to the GY by a card effect: You can Special Summon this card. | Rullkallos has an included Solemn Warning that makes her terrifing. She can also revive (only once) by sending a Tear card from your field or hand. This can be pretty useful to pitch your Sulliek for example to search for TKash or even Havnis to have an extra interaction during your opponent's turn. It can also protect your Aqua monsters like Toad, the girls or even a Gameciel your opponent gave you. |
| 1 | ![Tearlaments Kaleido-Heart](/cards/kaleido.jpg) | "Tearlaments Reinoheart" **or** "King of the Swamp" + 2 Aqua monsters. Cannot be used as Fusion Material. If this card is Special Summoned, or if an Aqua monster is sent to your GY by card effect while this card is on the field: You can target 1 card your opponent controls; shuffle it into the Deck. If this card is sent to the GY by card effect: You can Special Summon this card, and if you do, send 1 "Tearlaments" card from your Deck to the GY. You can only use each effect of "Tearlaments Kaleido-Heart" once per turn. | The most terrifying monster to play against. Kaleido can spin any card on Summon or when he revives and can also send any Tear card from your deck to your GY. You can for example make Kaleido during your turn, kill it with Perlereino, then revive it and send Scream or Sulliek to have access to any card in your deck.<br /><br />Don't forget that you can make it with any Aqua monster (like Toad or Gameciel). Also, you can make it with two Kings; one being Reino and the other the Aqua monster.<br /><br />Finally, don't forget no one can fuse with it. So if your opponent plays Fallen of Albaz or Super Poly they will not able to remove it. The same is for you, if you want to spin it back to the extra deck, you'll need a Shuffler or Metanoise. |
| 1 | ![Grapha, Dragon Overlord of Dark World](/cards/grapha.jpg) | ~~"Grapha, Dragon Lord of Dark World"~~ "King of the Swamp" + 1 DARK monster. When your opponent activates a monster effect, or a Normal Spell/Trap Card, while you have a card(s) in your hand (Quick Effect): You can activate this effect; the activated effect becomes "Your opponent discards 1 card". You can only use this effect of "Grapha, Dragon Overlord of Dark World" once per turn. If this Fusion Summoned card in its owner's control leaves the field because of an opponent's card: You can Special Summon 1 of your "Grapha, Dragon Lord of Dark World" that is banished or in your GY, then each player with a hand discards 1 card. | Little tip with Grapha: Grapha only checkes if you have cards to discard on activation. If on resolution you don't have anything, the effect will still resolve. For example, lets say your hand is only TKash. You can CL1 Grapha, CL2 TKash. TKash will be Summoned and Grapha will not discard anything because on activation you respected the conditions. |
| 1 | ![Mudragon of the Swamp](/cards/mudragon.jpg) | 2 monsters with the same Attribute but different Types. Your opponent cannot target this card, or monsters on the field with the same Attribute as this card, with card effects. Once per turn (Quick Effect): You can declare 1 Attribute; this card becomes that Attribute until the end of this turn. | Mostly a Super Poly target, but can also help to protect your Dark monsters or even make Toad with Reino. |
| 0-1 | ![Garura, Wings of Resonant Life](/cards/garura.jpg) | 2 monsters with the same Type and Attribute, but different names. Any battle damage your opponent takes from battles involving this card is doubled. If this card is sent to the GY: You can draw 1 card. You can only use this effect of "Garura, Wings of Resonant Life" once per turn. | This is mostly a Super Poly target. Can also help in very niche circumstance to make Beatrice. |
| 1 | ![Predaplant Dragostapelia](/cards/dragostapelia.jpg) | 1 Fusion Monster + 1 DARK monster. Once per turn (Quick Effect): You can target 1 face-up monster your opponent controls; place 1 Predator Counter on it, and if it is Level 2 or higher, it becomes Level 1 as long as it has a Predator Counter. Negate the activated effects of your opponent's monsters that have Predator Counters. | Another Super Poly target, but can also be made to kill Xyz or Spright decks by changing the monter's Level. It is also a monster negate which is nice. |
| 1 | ![Guardian Chimera](/cards/chimera.jpg) | 3 monsters with different names. Must first be Fusion Summoned using only Fusion Materials from your hand and field, with at least 1 monster from each. If this card is Fusion Summoned by a Spell Card or effect: You can draw cards equal to the number of cards used as material from the hand, and if you do, destroy cards your opponent controls equal to the number of cards used as material from the field. You can only use this effect of "Guardian Chimera" once per turn. While "Polymerization" is in your GY, your opponent cannot target this card with card effects. | Principally here to unbrick you when you go first, or to make you win when you are going second. It is also bigger than Grapha and untargetable when Poly is in the GY. |
| 1 | ![Time Thief Redoer](/cards/redoer.jpg) | 2 Level 4 monsters. Once per turn, during the Standby Phase: You can attach the top card of your opponent's Deck to this card as material. (Quick Effect): You can detach up to 3 different types of materials from this card, then apply the following effect(s) depending on what was detached. ● Monster: Banish this card until the End Phase. ● Spell: Draw 1 card. ● Trap: Place 1 face-up card your opponent controls on the top of the Deck. You can only use this effect of "Time Thief Redoer" once per turn. | Your best Rank 4 monster that will trigger Shreiren fusion (because it sends as an effect). You can steal imortant combo pieces from your opponent's deck, and can trigger Sheiren during your opponent's turn.<br /><br />__Don't steal your opponent's cards. Always check before pickup up your cards.__ |
| 1 | ![Baronne de Fleur](/cards/baronne.jpg) | 10 stars. 1 Tuner + 1+ non-Tuner monsters. Once per turn: You can target 1 card on the field; destroy it. Once while face-up on the field, when a card or effect is activated (Quick Effect): You can negate the activation, and if you do, destroy that card. You can only use the previous effect of "Baronne de Fleur" once per turn. Once per turn, during the Standby Phase: You can target 1 Level 9 or lower monster in your GY; return this card to the Extra Deck, and if you do, Special Summon that monster. | Incredible omni-negate that can pop your own cards to extend your plays. Also, once you have used your omni, you can revive any important monster in your GY (except Grapha) to continue your plays. |

#### Rullkallos or Grapaha?

Normally, Grapha is better: it is bigger and can negate more things. It also triggers the card you will discard. But, in some cases you will need to do Rullkallos:

- If you will not have a card to discard with Grapha.
- If you have Heartbeat and/or Cryme, and don't have enough cards to discard.
- If you have one of the Spell/Traps that need a Tear name and you don't have a name in board (or Havnis/TKash in hand).
- If you know Rullkallos will be enough and you will gain more advantage of its revive.
- If you need to protect your other Aqua monsters (specially Toad).

#### Perlereino/Baronne pop your own cards

During your turn, you can always pop your own cards to maximise your effets.

The easiest card to pop is Kaleido-Heart, because he will then return and mill a Tear card. Normally you will send Scream, to search for any Trap in your deck.

### The rest

| Quantity | Card | Effect | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0-1 | ![Mudora](/cards/mudora.jpg) | You can discard 1 other EARTH Fairy monster; Special Summon this card from your hand, ~~then you can place 1 "Gravekeeper's Trap" from your Deck face-up in your Spell & Trap Zone.~~ (Quick Effect): You can banish this card from your field or GY, then target up to 3 cards in any GY(s), ~~or up to 5 if "Exchange of the Spirit" is on your field or in your GY~~; shuffle them into the Deck. You can only use each effect of "Mudora the Sword Oracle" once per turn. | The worst of the Shufflers. Mudora is good to discard your Millers and to shuffle back cards from the GY. |
| 1 | ![Keldo](/cards/keldo.jpg) | You can discard 1 other EARTH Fairy monster; Special Summon this card from your hand, then add 1 "Exchange of the Spirit" or 1 card that mentions it from your Deck to your hand. (Quick Effect): You can banish this card from your field or GY, then target up to 3 cards in any GY(s), ~~or up to 5 if "Exchange of the Spirit" is on your field or in your GY~~; shuffle them into the Deck. You can only use each effect of "Keldo the Sacred Protector" once per turn. | Keldo is like a better Mudora. When you activate it's effect in hand you need (mandatory) to search for another Ishizu monster; I would recommend to get Kelbek for another interaction. |
| 1 | ![Agido](/cards/agido.jpg) |  If a card(s) is sent from the hand or Deck to your opponent's GY (except during the Damage Step): You can Special Summon this card from your hand, then you can Special Summon 1 Level 4 EARTH Fairy monster from your GY, except "Agido the Ancient Sentinel". If this card is sent from the hand or Deck to the GY: You can activate this effect; each player sends the top 5 cards of their Deck to the GY (or their entire Deck, if less than 5), ~~then, if "Exchange of the Spirit" is in your GY, you can send 5 more cards from the top of either player's Deck to the GY~~. You can only use each effect of "Agido the Ancient Sentinel" once per turn. | The worst of the Millers. It can monster reborn another Ishizu to make Rank 4 plays, but it's mostly useful when sent to the GY to mill 5. |
| 1 | ![Kelbek](/cards/kelbek.jpg) | If a card(s) is sent from the hand or Deck to your opponent's GY (except during the Damage Step): You can target 1 Special Summoned monster your opponent controls; Special Summon this card from your hand, then return that monster to the hand. If this card is sent from the hand or Deck to the GY: You can activate this effect; each player sends the top 5 cards of their Deck to the GY (or their entire Deck, if less than 5), ~~then, if "Exchange of the Spirit" is in your GY, you can Set 1 Trap from your GY~~. You can only use each effect of "Kelbek the Ancient Vanguard" once per turn. | Kelbek has a crazy effect in hand and when sent to the GY. It is clearly the best of the Ishizu cards. Use it wisely, sometimes it's better to return a monster to the hand to interrupt your opponent's plays instead of milling 5. |
| 3 | ![King of the Swamp](/cards/king.jpg) | This card can be used as a substitute for any 1 Fusion Material whose name is specifically listed on the Fusion Monster Card, but the other Fusion Material(s) must be correct. You can discard this card to the Graveyard; add 1 "Polymerization" from your Deck to your hand. | Used to tutor for Poly and have access to your strong fusions. |
| 0-1 | ![Trivikarma](/cards/trivikarma.jpg) | ~~Target 1 "Visas Starfrost" in your Monster Zone and 1 Effect Monster your opponent controls; negate that opponent's monster's effects, and if you do, your targeted monster gains ATK equal to half of that monster's original ATK or DEF (whichever is higher).~~ You can banish this card from your GY; add 1 Spell/Trap that mentions "Visas Starfrost" from your Deck to your hand, except "Trivikarma". You can only use 1 "Trivikarma" effect per turn, and only once that turn. | This allows you to shuffle back your deck when you want to remove your girls from the bottom, and also, searches almost any Spell/Trap you need. You will never use the first effect, unless you play Visas, so this card is a brick in hand (but there are many ways to discard it). |

#### Your Miller's effect on the GY will trigger the effect of the other Miller in hand

Since, you force your opponent to send a card from his deck to the GY and your Millers say: `If a card(s) is sent from the hand or Deck to your opponent's GY (except during the Damage Step)`, once you activate for example Agido, you would be able to chain Kelbek in hand.

#### Shuffle your deck when your girls are in the bottom

Wait until your names are in the bottom to shuffle your deck. You have many ways to shuffle it: Malicious, Beatrice, Shufflers, Trivikarma, Reino, Terraforming, Foolish, Foolish Goods... This is mostly important when you make Garura with two girls or when you make two fusions back-to-back. You need to put the girls back in any order in your deck; if they are in the bottom you know you will never see them anymore.

#### If you use your Shufflers try to go to 3 cards even if you have nothing to select

Let's say for example that you want to shuffle back your Reino in your GY (and nothing else), and your opponent has nothing good in his GY. You can always shuffle back useless cards to hurt the consistency of their deck.

### Example of the deck

You can reduce Reino to minimum __2__ if you add some **Diviner of the Herald**s.

Some people don't play Heartbeat, Foolish nor Garura. It's up to you to see if you want to play them.

Abyss Dweller seems a staple in the current format because of Unchained and Chimera. Play it main or side, depending if you have room or not.

![Core cards](decks/core.png)

## Versions

### Pure with spice

Once you have your core cards, you can now chose what splash you want to add. You have three principal splashes:

#### Hero package

Gives access to Beatrice.

| Quantity | Card | Effect | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | ![Destiny HERO - Malicious](/cards/malicious.jpg) | You can banish this card from your GY; Special Summon 1 "Destiny HERO - Malicious" from your Deck. | Nothing to say, you need both to make Dangerous. Then, you need to banish one Mali to Summon the other and then make Beatrice with Dangerous and Malicious. Note: if you have one Mali in hand and the other in GY, you will need to fuse using the one in hand. If you don't you will not be able to Summon the one that will be shuffled back. |
| 1 | ![Destiny HERO - Dangerous](/cards/dangerous.jpg) | 1 "Destiny HERO" monster + 1 DARK Effect Monster. (Quick Effect): You can discard 1 card; send 1 "Destiny HERO" monster from your hand or Deck to the GY, and if you do, "Destiny HERO" monsters you control gain 200 ATK for each "Destiny HERO" monster in your GY until the end of this turn. You can only use this effect of "Destiny HERO - Dangerous" once per turn. | I don't like to use the Quick Effect to get to Malicious since it discards as cost and not as effect, but sometimes you have no choice. |
| 1 | ![Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal](/cards/beatrice.jpg) | 2 Level 6 monsters. ~~You can also Xyz Summon this card by sending 1 "Burning Abyss" monster from your hand to the GY, then using 1 "Dante" monster you control as material. (Transfer its materials to this card.) If Summoned this way, the following effect cannot be activated this turn.~~ Once per turn (Quick Effect): You can detach 1 material from this card; send 1 card from your Deck to the GY. If this card in your possession is destroyed by your opponent's card and sent to your GY: You can Special Summon 1 "Burning Abyss" monster from your Extra Deck, ignoring its Summoning conditions. | You need two Level 6 to make her. Normally you will use Malicious and Dangerous, but know that Garura and Diviner are also Level 6. Her main purpose is to pitch any card that will help you to gain advantage. If you have nothing to pitch, you can keep her materials for Spright Sprind. Also, always remove Dangerous first, it will give you a fusion in your GY in case you need to make Dragostapelia. |

#### Toad package

Gives access to another omni negate.

| Quantity | Card | Effect | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | ![Radian, the Multidimensional Kaiju](/cards/radian.jpg) | You can Special Summon this card (from your hand) to your opponent's field in Attack Position, by Tributing 1 monster they control. If your opponent controls a "Kaiju" monster, you can Special Summon this card (from your hand) in Attack Position. You can only control 1 "Kaiju" monster. ~~Once per turn: You can remove 2 Kaiju Counters from anywhere on the field; Special Summon 1 "Radian Token" (Fiend/DARK/Level 7/ATK 2800/DEF 0), but it cannot be used as Synchro Material.~~ | You need more Darks to make Mudragon of the Swamp with your girls, and then make Bahamuth Shark with it and Reino. Don't play Gameciel unless you want more Kaijus, but I don't think that it's needed. |
| 1 | ![Bahamut Shark](/cards/bahamut.jpg) | 2 Level 4 WATER monsters. Once per turn: You can detach 1 material from this card; Special Summon 1 Rank 3 or lower WATER Xyz Monster from your Extra Deck. This card cannot attack for the rest of this turn. | Make it with two Reinos or Reino and Mudragon. Note: you can't attak then activate its effect. |
| 1 | ![Toadly Awesome](/cards/toad.jpg) | 2 Level 2 Aqua monsters. Once per turn, during the Standby Phase: You can detach 1 material from this card; Special Summon 1 "Frog" monster from your Deck. Once per turn, when your opponent activates a Spell/Trap Card, or monster effect (Quick Effect): You can send 1 Aqua monster from your hand or face-up field to the GY; negate the activation, and if you do, destroy that card, then you can Set it to your field. If this card is sent to the GY: You can target 1 WATER monster in your GY; add it to your hand. | Great omni. It's an Aqua so it can be used to make Kaleido. Also, when it dies, it will recycle TKash or Reino. Finally, since Bahamuth is not a threat, if it's still alive on your turn and you shuffled back Toad, you can make it again. |

#### Winda package

Gives access to a strong floodgate.

| Quantity | Card | Effect | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | ![Shaddoll Beast](/cards/beast.jpg) | ~~FLIP: You can draw 2 cards, then discard 1 card.~~ If this card is sent to the GY by a card effect: You can draw 1 card. You can only use 1 "Shaddoll Beast" effect per turn, and only once that turn. | Use it to [chainblock](#chainblocking) Belle or Ash. Also, in hand, it's very useless. You will never set it, but maybe if it happens it can help you. |
| 0-1 | ![Shaddoll Squamata](/cards/squamata.jpg) | FLIP: You can target 1 monster on the field; destroy it. If this card is sent to the GY by a card effect: You can send 1 "Shaddoll" card from your Deck to the GY, except "Shaddoll Squamata". You can only use 1 "Shaddoll Squamata" effect per turn, and only once that turn. | It's a brick even when milled if you already milled your Shaddoll Beast. But it is a Dark, so it can help making Mudragon, and it is a Level 4. In worst case scenario, you can set it. |
| 0-1 | ![Helshaddoll Hollow](/cards/helshaddoll.jpg) | ~~FLIP: You can target 1 face-up monster your opponent controls; send 1 "Shaddoll" monster with its same Attribute from your Extra Deck to the GY, and if you do, banish that monster.~~ If this card is sent to the GY by card effect: You can send cards from the top of your Deck to the GY, equal to the number of different original Attributes among the monsters on the field. You can only use 1 "Helshaddoll Hollow" effect per turn, and only once that turn. | A better version of Squamata, but it's not a Dark and it's not a Level 4. Also, in hand, it's very useless. You will never set it, but maybe if it happens it can help you. |
| 1 | ![El Shaddoll Winda](/cards/winda.jpg) | 1 "Shaddoll" monster + 1 DARK monster. Must first be Fusion Summoned. Cannot be destroyed by an opponent's card effects. Each player can only Special Summon monster(s) once per turn while this card is face-up on the field. If this card is sent to the GY: You can target 1 "Shaddoll" Spell/Trap in your GY; add it to your hand. | She can not be destroyed by card effect, and she will block you if you want to Special Summon more than once. Be careful when you play her: the timing is the key. |

#### Danger package

You can also add a little three, four or five Danger cards to add more spice.

| Quantity | Card | Effect | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2-3 | ![Danger Nessie](/cards/nessie.jpg) | You can reveal this card in your hand; your opponent randomly chooses 1 card from your entire hand, then you discard the chosen card. Then, if the discarded card was not "Danger! Nessie!", Special Summon 1 "Danger! Nessie!" from your hand, and if you do, draw 1 card. If this card is discarded: You can add 1 "Danger!" card from your Deck to your hand, except "Danger! Nessie!". You can only use this effect of "Danger! Nessie!" once per turn. | Great card to draw or to Summon Mothman from deck. It's also a Dark Aqua Level 7: so you can make Garura and Rank 7 plays with it. |
| 1-2 | ![Danger Mothman](/cards/mothman.jpg) | You can reveal this card in your hand; your opponent randomly chooses 1 card from your entire hand, then you discard the chosen card. Then, if the discarded card was not "Danger! Mothman!", Special Summon 1 "Danger! Mothman!" from your hand, and if you do, draw 1 card. If this card is discarded: You can have both players draw 1 card, then both players discard 1 card. You can only use this effect of "Danger! Mothman!" once per turn. | It's a Dark Level 4 and can maybe help you getting rid of a brick in hand. It can also get you into Rank 4 plays and Mudragon. |

Here is an example of a Danger deck:

![Dangers deck](decks/dangers.png)

##### Nessie or Mothman first?

Some ways to think it, but it always depends on your build and your board:

- If you don't have another Mothman in the deck, you should use Nessie first, because if you hit Mothman, you will not be able to have it on board. And, if you hit Nessie, nothing will happen.
- If you need a Level 7 to make a Synchro-10 play or you need another Level 7 to make Dracossack, you should do Nessie first.
- If you need to make a Synchro-10 play or you need another Level 4 to make a Rank 4-Xyz, you should do Mothman first.
- If you have another Mothman in the deck, and you have a good card to discard in your hand (like Trivikarma, Malicious, a Shuffler...) you can use Mothman first, because if you hit itself you can always discard that card. But, if you hit Nessie, you will only have a Level 4 in play, a dead card in hand and a draw.
- Do you need a bigger body? If so, you should do Nessie first.

#### Mix the packages

All of those packages complement well each other and you can mix them. For example:

- Malicious/Shaddoll and a Tear girl can make Mudragon to have access to Bahamuth/Toad.
- Beatrice can pitch a Shaddoll to have access to Winda. See the combo in the [combo section](#example-of-endboard-with-beatrice-and-winda).

##### Winda and Toad deck

![Winda Toad deck](decks/winda-toad.png)

##### Winda, Beatrice and Toad deck

![Winda Hero Toad deck](decks/winda-hero-toad.png)

### Shaddoll deck

The objective of this version is to always garantee a Winda. It takes lots of places on your extra deck, but its pretty consistent. You will play the Winda package + some extra cards listed below. See the combo in the [combo section](#shaddoll-combo).

| Quantity | Card | Effect | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| At least one in this list:<br /><br />0-1<br /><br />0-1-2-3 | ![Shaddoll Falco](/cards/falco.jpg) ![Diviner of the Herald](/cards/diviner.jpg) | FLIP: You can target 1 "Shaddoll" monster in your GY, except "Shaddoll Falco"; Special Summon it in face-down Defense Position. If this card is sent to the GY by a card effect: You can Special Summon it in face-down Defense Position. You can only use 1 "Shaddoll Falco" effect per turn, and only once that turn.<br /><br />If this card is Normal or Special Summoned: You can send 1 Fairy monster from your Deck or Extra Deck to the GY, and if you do, increase this card's Level by that monster's Level, until the end of this turn. If this card is Tributed: You can Special Summon 1 Level 2 or lower Fairy monster from your hand or Deck, except "Diviner of the Herald". You can only use each effect of "Diviner of the Herald" once per turn. | Some people prefer Diviner, some prefer Falco. Diviner is not a brick in hand, but Falco is. You need to choose one to allow your Synchro plays (you will revive the tuner with Cross-Sheep).<br /><br />Diviner's pros is that is a good Normal Summon that can send a Miller and become Level 6. You can then make Baronne with a Level 4. If it gets negated, you can use it to make Sprind and then send Merrli.<br /><br />Falco's pros is that is a Dark Shaddoll. |
| 1 | ![Shaddoll Schism](/cards/schism.jpg) | During the Main Phase, you can: Fusion Summon 1 "Shaddoll" Fusion Monster from your Extra Deck, by banishing Fusion Materials listed on it from your field or GY, but it cannot attack directly. Then, you can send to the GY 1 monster your opponent controls with the same Attribute as that Fusion Summoned monster. You can only use this effect of "Shaddoll Schism" once per turn. | This will allow you to make Winda during your opponent's turn. It can also be used to remove a monster. |
| 0-1 Main<br /><br />2-3 The rest sideboard | ![Shaddoll Fusion](/cards/shaddoll-fusion.jpg) | Fusion Summon 1 "Shaddoll" Fusion Monster from your Extra Deck, using monsters from your hand or field as Fusion Material. If your opponent controls a monster that was Special Summoned from the Extra Deck, you can also use monsters in your Deck as Fusion Material. You can only activate 1 "Shaddoll Fusion" per turn. | Incredible going second card! The best play you can make is to make Shekinaga by foolishing Agido and Beast to draw 1 and mill 5. |
| 1 | ![El Shaddoll Apkallone](/cards/apkallone.jpg) | 2 "Shaddoll" monsters with different Attributes. Must first be Fusion Summoned. Cannot be destroyed by battle. You can only use each of the following effects of "El Shaddoll Apkallone" once per turn. ● If this card is Special Summoned: You can target 1 face-up card on the field; negate its effects. ● If this card is sent to the GY: You can add 1 "Shaddoll" card from your Deck or GY to your hand, then discard 1 card. | You will rarely Summon it. Apkallone is mostly here to be pitched with Granguignol and then tutor a Shaddoll card and pitch a card from your hand (no need to be the same). |
| 0-1 | ![El Shaddoll Construct](/cards/construct.jpg) | 1 "Shaddoll" monster + 1 LIGHT monster. Must first be Fusion Summoned. If this card is Special Summoned: You can send 1 "Shaddoll" card from your Deck to the GY. At the start of the Damage Step, if this card battles a Special Summoned monster: Destroy that monster. If this card is sent to the GY: You can target 1 "Shaddoll" Spell/Trap in your GY; add it to your hand. | You normally use Grangignol and a Shaddoll monster to make it. And then make Baronne with Falco or Diviner (you revive the tuner with Cross-Sheep). It's effect can also be useful to pitch Helshaddoll and mill a lot or to destroy a monster on field. Don't forget the effect when sent to GY. |
| 1 | ![El Shaddoll Shekinaga](/cards/shekinaga.jpg) | 1 "Shaddoll" monster + 1 EARTH monster. Must first be Fusion Summoned. When a Special Summoned monster activates its effect while you have a "Shaddoll" card in your hand (Quick Effect): You can negate the activation, and if you do, destroy that monster, then send 1 "Shaddoll" card from your hand to the GY. You can only use this effect of "El Shaddoll Shekhinaga" once per turn. If this card is sent to the GY: You can target 1 "Shaddoll" Spell/Trap in your GY; add it to your hand. | Mostly here to give access the Shaddoll Fusion play with the Millers. It's other effect can also be good, but hard to set-up. Don't forget the effect when sent to GY. |
| 1 | ![Granguignol the Dusk Dragon](/cards/granguignol.jpg) | ~~"Blazing Cartesia, the Virtuous"~~ "King of the Swamp" + 1 LIGHT or DARK monster. If this card is Fusion Summoned: You can send 1 Level 6 or higher LIGHT or DARK monster from your Deck or Extra Deck to the GY. If a monster is Special Summoned by your opponent's activated monster effect (except during the Damage Step): You can banish this card from your field or GY; Special Summon 1 "Dogmatika" monster from your Deck or 1 "Despia" monster from your Extra Deck. You can only use each effect of "Granguignol the Dusk Dragon" once per turn. | It's only here to pitch Apkallone (or Garura if you have nothing else to pitch). It's also a Level 8 (so can make Baronne with a Level 2) and a Light monster (to make Construct). |

![Shaddoll deck](decks/shaddoll.png)

#### Variant

You can also play a small Shaddoll package with only Shekinaga and 3 Shaddoll Fusions in your sideboard:

![Shaddoll Toad deck](decks/shaddoll-toad.png)

### Revolution deck

This version can almost always guarantee a Field Spell (with Ancient Fairy then Amritara). It can also make a two card combo with Revolution and Fenrir. See the combo in the [combo section](#revolution-combo).

You can add more spice too, check the [Spicy cards for a more Synchro-heavy deck](#spicy-cards-for-a-more-synchro-heavy-deck) section.

| Quantity | Card | Effect | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2-3 | ![Revolution Synchron](/cards/revolution.jpg) | If you Synchro Summon a ~~"Power Tool" Synchro Monster or a~~ Level 7 or 8 Dragon Synchro Monster, this card in your hand can also be used as material. You can only use this effect of "Revolution Synchron" once per turn. If you control a Level 7 or higher Synchro Monster while this card is in your GY: You can send the top card of your Deck to the GY, and if you do, Special Summon this card, also its Level becomes 1. You can only use this effect of "Revolution Synchron" once per Duel. | The key card of this version. You use it to make Ancient Fairy Dragon or Baronne (with a Kashtira monster). Then, you can revive it and make Visas, and continue playing... |
| 1-2-3 | ![Tuning](/cards/tuning.jpg) | Add 1 "Synchron" Tuner from your Deck to your hand, then send the top card of your Deck to the GY. | Great card, but plays into Droll. |
| 1 | ![Ancient Fairy Dragon](/cards/ancient-fairy.jpg) | 7 stars. 1 Tuner + 1+ non-Tuner monsters. During your Main Phase: You can Special Summon 1 Level 4 or lower monster from your hand. You cannot conduct your Battle Phase the turn you activate this effect. During your Main Phase: You can destroy as many cards in the Field Zones as possible (min. 1), and if you do, gain 1000 LP, then you can add 1 Field Spell with a different name than the destroyed card(s), from your Deck to your hand. You can only use each effect of "Ancient Fairy Dragon" once per turn. | Great card that can win you the Time and can pop your own Wraitsoth to search for Perlereino. It's also insane against any deck that has fields pells like Rescue-Ace, Purrely, Runick or Traptrix for example.<br /><br />You can activate the effect to Special Summon when going first.<br /><br />The effect to destroy a Field Spell doesn't target. Also, if there are 2 Field Spell Cards on the field the effect of AFD will destroy both of them. |
| 1 | ![Visas Amritara](/cards/amritara.jpg) | 8 stars. 1+ Tuners + 1 LIGHT monster. This card's name becomes "Visas Starfrost" while on the field. You can only use each of the following effects of "Visas Amritara" once per turn. If this card is Synchro Summoned: You can add 1 Spell/Trap that mentions "Visas Starfrost" from your Deck to your hand. During your Main Phase: You can destroy 1 monster you control, also all Synchro Monsters you control will gain 800 ATK this turn. | This will tutor for almost any Spell/Trap in your deck. This will also give your Heartbeat and Trivikarma an extra effect. Finally, the monster pop might be relevant, don't forget you have it. |

You can build it in many ways. Here are some examples:

#### Revolution Toad

![Revolution Toad deck](decks/revolution-toad.png)

#### Revolution Shaddoll

![Revolution Shaddoll deck](decks/revolution-shaddoll.png)

### Budget deck

For this version I have cut the big cards: Field Spells, Fenrir, Guardian Chimera, Garura, Super Poly. Tearlaments Kashtira is quite expensive too but it's mandatory. I've also added one Perlereino because it's super strong, but you can replace it and Terraforming with more Dangers for example.

![Budget deck](decks/budget.png)

### OCG Horus

The Horus support will be good for this deck. It allows you to play The Zombie Vampire, which is a crazy Rank 8 because of this effect: `You can detach 1 material from this card; each player sends the top 4 cards from their Deck to the GY, then if any monsters were sent to either GY by this effect, you can Special Summon 1 of those monsters to your field.`

This is not an official deck at all. It's an example of what a Horus deck could look like:

![Horus deck](decks/horus.png)

## Mainboard spicy cards

### General spicy cards

All those cards are facultative. You can run 0 or the number I precised. I'll not list all the cards that are possible, but here are some of them:

| Quantity | Card | Effect | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-2-3 | ![Diviner of the Herald](/cards/diviner.jpg) | If this card is Normal or Special Summoned: You can send 1 Fairy monster from your Deck or Extra Deck to the GY, and if you do, increase this card's Level by that monster's Level, until the end of this turn. If this card is Tributed: You can Special Summon 1 Level 2 or lower Fairy monster from your hand or Deck, except "Diviner of the Herald". You can only use each effect of "Diviner of the Herald" once per turn. | Good Normal Summon that can send a Miller and become Level 6. You can then make Baronne with a Level 4 or Beatrice with a Level 6. If it gets negated, you can use it to make Sprind and then send Merrli. |
| 3 in total | ![Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju](/cards/gameciel.jpg) ![Radian, the Multidimensional Kaiju](/cards/radian.jpg) | You can Special Summon this card (from your hand) to your opponent's field in Attack Position, by Tributing 1 monster they control. If your opponent controls a "Kaiju" monster, you can Special Summon this card (from your hand) in Attack Position. You can only control 1 "Kaiju" monster. ~~When your opponent activates a card or effect, except "Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju" (Quick Effect): You can remove 2 Kaiju Counters from anywhere on the field; negate the activation, and if you do, banish that card.~~<br /><br />You can Special Summon this card (from your hand) to your opponent's field in Attack Position, by Tributing 1 monster they control. If your opponent controls a "Kaiju" monster, you can Special Summon this card (from your hand) in Attack Position. You can only control 1 "Kaiju" monster. ~~Once per turn: You can remove 2 Kaiju Counters from anywhere on the field; Special Summon 1 "Radian Token" (Fiend/DARK/Level 7/ATK 2800/DEF 0), but it cannot be used as Synchro Material.~~ | Gameciel is clearly very good because it's has the lowest ATK. It is also an Aqua, so can be used to make Kaleido. Also, if you are playing Toad package you can return this from your GY to your hand when Toad dies. But, I think that Radian is better because it's a Dark and can allow Mudragon plays. |
| 1-2-3 | ![Kashtira Fenrir](/cards/fenrir.jpg) | If you control no monsters, you can Special Summon this card (from your hand). You can only use each of the following effects of "Kashtira Fenrir" once per turn. During your Main Phase: You can add 1 "Kashtira" monster from your Deck to your hand. When this card declares an attack, or if your opponent activates a monster effect (except during the Damage Step): You can target 1 face-up card your opponent controls; banish it, face-down. | If you can't win against Kashtira, join them. You only play this because it's a crazy card to play. It's very strong and can be very good going first or second. You can even topdeck this card and win a game. It has lots of synergies with Tearlaments Kashtira and can allow [Draccossack](#dracossack---cherubini---sprind), [Destrudo](#destrudo-in-gy-combo) or [Revolution Synchron](#revolution-combo) plays. |
| 1 | ![Pressured Planet Wraitsoth](/cards/wraitsoth.jpg) | When this card is activated: You can add 1 "Kashtira" monster from your Deck to your hand. Monsters you control gain 100 ATK/DEF for each different Attribute on the field. ~~If a "Kashtira Shangri-Ira" you control activates an effect (except during the Damage Step): You can target 1 card on the field; destroy it.~~ You can only use this effect of "Pressured Planet Wraitsoth" once per turn. You can only activate 1 "Pressured Planet Wraitsoth" per turn. | Useful to bait an Ash or to search for Ferir or TKash. It also boosts the ATK __and__ DEF, so consider it. Normally, you want to play this before Perlereino. |

### Extra-deck spice

| Quantity | Card | Effect | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | ![Number 41 Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir](/cards/bagooska.jpg) | 2 Level 4 monsters. Once per turn, during your Standby Phase, detach 1 material from this card. If you cannot, destroy it. This Attack Position card cannot be destroyed by your opponent's card effects. Your opponent cannot target this Attack Position card with card effects. While this card is in face-up Defense Position, change all face-up monsters on the field to Defense Position, also negate the activated effects of monsters that were in Defense Position when that effect was activated. | If you get stopped and have nothing to do, you can make Redoer or Bagooska. Sometimes, Bagooska feels right if you need some time turn re-setup. |
| 1 | ![Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder](/cards/zeus.jpg) | ~~2 Level 12 monsters.~~ Once per turn, if an Xyz Monster battled this turn, you can also Xyz Summon "Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder" by using 1 Xyz Monster you control as material. (Transfer its materials to this card.) (Quick Effect): You can detach 2 materials from this card; send all other cards from the field to the GY. Once per turn, if another card(s) you control is destroyed by battle or an opponent's card effect: You can attach 1 card from your hand, Deck, or Extra Deck to this card as material. | Great boardwipe. Don't forget that it will trigger all your cards that have effects when sent to the GY. It can also be useful if you play TTTalents: you steal an Xyz, attack with it, and slam Zeus over it. |
| 1 | ![Barricadeborg Blocker](/cards/blocker.jpg) | 2 monsters with different names. If this card is Link Summoned: You can discard 1 card; during the End Phase of this turn, add 1 Continuous or Field Spell from your GY to your hand. You can only use this effect of "Barricadeborg Blocker" once per turn. Face-up Spells you control cannot be destroyed by your opponent's card effects. | A generic Link 2 that can unbrick some awkard hands. It can also recycle Scream or a Planet from GY to the hand. It can also be used as the Link 2 to make Sprind. |
| 1 | ![Cross-Sheep](/cards/cross-sheep.jpg) | 2 monsters with different names. If a monster is Special Summoned to a zone this card points to: You can apply the following effects, in sequence, based on the card types of the monster(s) this card points to. ~~● Ritual: Draw 2 cards, then discard 2 cards.~~ ● Fusion: Special Summon 1 Level 4 or lower monster from your GY. ● Synchro: All monsters you control gain 700 ATK. ● Xyz: All monsters your opponent controls lose 700 ATK. You can only use this effect of "Cross-Sheep" once per turn. | The main purpose of this card is to make a fusion during your opponent's turn under its arrows to then revive Reino or Diviner, and then mill (and continue your plays). See the combo in the [combo section](#example-of-endboard-with-cross-sheep-and-redoer). It can also be used as the Link 2 to make Sprind. |
| 1 | ![Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy](/cards/dharc.jpg) | 2 monsters, including a DARK monster. ~~(This card is always treated as a "Familiar-Possessed" card.)~~ You can target 1 DARK monster in your opponent's GY; Special Summon it to your zone this card points to. If this Link Summoned card is destroyed by battle, or is destroyed by an opponent's card effect while in its owner's Monster Zone: You can add 1 DARK monster with 1500 or less DEF from your Deck to your hand. You can only use each effect of "Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy" once per turn. | If you play against a Dark deck, Dharc is insane to take any strong monster they have. It can also be used as the Link 2 to make Sprind. The tutor effect will not happen often, but if it does, you can maybe add: Havnis, Sheiren, Malicious, Mothman, Squamata or Falco for example. |
| 1 | ![Underworld Goddess of the Closed World](/cards/goddess.jpg) | 4+ Effect Monsters. You can also use 1 monster your opponent controls as material to Link Summon this card. If this card is Link Summoned: You can negate the effects of all face-up monsters your opponent currently controls. This Link Summoned card is unaffected by your opponent's activated effects, unless they target this card. Once per turn, when your opponent activates a card or effect that Special Summons a monster(s) from the GY (Quick Effect): You can negate the activation. | Principally here to remove the towers. Once it's on board, it's almost unstopable. |
| 1 | ![Spright Sprind](/cards/sprind.jpg) | 2 monsters, including a Level/~~Rank~~/Link 2 monster. Cannot be used as Link Material the turn it is Link Summoned. You can only use 1 of the following effects of "Spright Sprind" per turn, and only once that turn. If this card is Link Summoned: You can send 1 Level 2 monster from your Deck to the GY. If another monster is Special Summoned while this card is on the field (except during the Damage Step): You can detach 1 material from an Xyz Monster you control, then target 1 monster on the field; return it to the hand. | Mostly here to pitch Merrli, but can also be useful with your Xyz monsters to bounce your opponent'sm monsters. |
| 1 | ![Millenium-Eyes Restrict](/cards/millenium-eyes.jpg) | ~~"Relinquished"~~ "King of the Swamp" + 1 Effect Monster. Once per turn, when your opponent activates a monster effect (Quick Effect): You can target 1 Effect Monster your opponent controls or in their GY; equip that target to this card you control. This card gains ATK/DEF equal to that equipped monster's. Monsters with that equipped monster's name cannot attack, also their effects on the field and their activated effects are negated. | This can be used as a Hand Trap stoper or a good going second card. If you want to play this, you might consider playing Instant Fusion too. |

### Spicy cards for a more Synchro-heavy deck

| Quantity | Card | Effect | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | ![Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson](/cards/destrudo.jpg) | If this card is in your hand or GY: You can pay half your LP, then target 1 Level 6 or lower monster you control; Special Summon this card, and if you do, this card's Level is reduced by the Level of the targeted monster, also place this card on the bottom of the Deck if it leaves the field. You can only use this effect of "Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson" once per turn. | The best card to lose on time. Also a great tuner that can be revived from the GY (or can even make Mudragon). You can see the combos [in the combo section](#destrudo-in-gy-combo). |
| 1 | ![Jet Synchron](/cards/jet.jpg) | ~~If this card is sent to the GY as Synchro Material: You can add 1 "Junk" monster from your Deck to your hand.~~ If this card is in your GY: You can send 1 card from your hand to the GY; Special Summon this card, but banish it when it leaves the field. You can only use 1 "Jet Synchron" effect per turn, and only once that turn. | Some people play this, some not. It's a good card to allow synchro plays, but the monster you pitch is not triggered. Also, it's a fire, so it has no consistency in this deck. |
| 1 | ![Naturia Beast](/cards/natbeast.jpg) | 5 stars. 1 EARTH Tuner + 1+ non-Tuner EARTH monsters. When a Spell Card is activated (Quick Effect): You can send the top 2 cards of your Deck to the GY; negate the activation, and if you do, destroy it. This card must be face-up on the field to activate and to resolve this effect. | Insta win against Spell decks. You make it with Jet Synchron or a revived Revolution Synchron (needs some setup), and a Level 4. The cards sent to GY will not trigger because they are sent as cost. |
| 1 | ![Black Rose Dragon](/cards/blackrose.jpg) | 7 stars. 1 Tuner + 1+ non-Tuner monsters. When this card is Synchro Summoned: You can destroy all cards on the field. ~~Once per turn: You can banish 1 Plant monster from your GY, then target 1 Defense Position monster your opponent controls; change that target to face-up Attack Position, and if you do, its ATK becomes 0 until the end of this turn.~~ | Zeus 2.0. Don't forget that it will trigger all your cards that have effects when sent to the GY. |
| 1 | ![F.A. Dawn Dragster](/cards/fa.jpg) | 7 stars. 1 Tuner + 1+ non-Tuner monsters. Gains ATK equal to its Level x 300. If this card attacks a Defense Position monster, inflict piercing battle damage. ~~Each time a "F.A." Spell/Trap Card or effect is activated: You can increase this card's Level by 1.~~ Once per turn, when your opponent activates a Spell/Trap Card or effect (Quick Effect): you can reduce this card's Level by 2, and if you do, negate the activation, and if you do that, destroy that card. | Another great Spell/Trap negate card. |
| 1 | ![Adamancipator Risen - Dragite](/cards/dragite.jpg) | 8 stars. 1 Tuner + 1+ non-Tuner monsters. During your Main Phase: You can excavate the top 5 cards of your Deck, and if you do, ~~you can return cards your opponent controls to the hand, up to the number of Rock monsters excavated~~, also place the excavated cards on the bottom of the Deck in any order. When your opponent activates a Spell/Trap Card or effect while a WATER monster is in your GY (Quick Effect): You can negate the activation, and if you do, destroy it. You can only use each effect of "Adamancipator Risen - Dragite" once per turn. | This is a good Spell/Trap negate. Sometimes the excavate effect could be useful to shuffle back the girls if they are in the bottom. Also, if you are playing Nibiru, you could be able to return some cards. |
| 1 | ![Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon](/cards/crystal-wing.jpg) | 8 stars. 1 Tuner + 1+ non-Tuner Synchro Monsters. Once per turn, when another monster's effect is activated (Quick Effect): You can negate the activation, and if you do, destroy that monster, and if you do that, this card gains ATK equal to the destroyed monster's original ATK until the end of this turn. If this card battles an opponent's Level 5 or higher monster, during damage calculation: This card gains ATK equal to the current ATK of the opponent's monster it is battling during that damage calculation only. | This is a monster negate and can battle almost any big monster. |
| 1 | ![Number 11 Big Eye](/cards/bigeye.jpg) | 2 Level 7 monsters. Once per turn: You can detach 1 material from this card, then target 1 monster your opponent controls; take control of that monster. This card cannot attack the turn this effect is activated. | Can be used when you brick on a Kashtira monster and Ancient Fairy Dragon or a Nessie. |

### Cherubini Package

See combo in the [combo section](#dracossack---cherubini---sprind).

| Quantity | Card | Effect | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-2-3 | ![Kashtira Fenrir](/cards/fenrir.jpg) | If you control no monsters, you can Special Summon this card (from your hand). You can only use each of the following effects of "Kashtira Fenrir" once per turn. During your Main Phase: You can add 1 "Kashtira" monster from your Deck to your hand. When this card declares an attack, or if your opponent activates a monster effect (except during the Damage Step): You can target 1 face-up card your opponent controls; banish it, face-down. | You will need Fenrir and TKash to make Dracossack. You can also play some Nessies to play Dracossack because they are Level 7 too. |
| 1 | ![Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack](/cards/dracossack.jpg) | 2 Level 7 monsters. Once per turn: You can detach 1 material from this card; Special Summon 2 "Mecha Phantom Beast Tokens" (Machine/WIND/Level 3/ATK 0/DEF 0). While you control a Token, this card cannot be destroyed by battle or card effects. Once per turn: You can Tribute 1 "Mecha Phantom Beast" monster, then target 1 card on the field; destroy that target. This card cannot attack during the turn you activate this effect. | Dracossack is mostly here to make the tokens that will Summon Cherubini. If you have another monster in play, you can also tribute it to destroy any card on the field. |
| 1 | ![Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss](/cards/cherubini.jpg) | 2 Level 3 monsters or 2 "Mecha Phantom Beast Tokens". Monsters this card points to cannot be destroyed by card effects. If this card on the field would be destroyed by battle or an opponent's card effect, you can send 1 other card you control to the GY instead. You can send 1 Level 3 monster from your Deck to the GY, then target 1 "Burning Abyss" monster on the field; it gains ATK/DEF equal to the sent monster's ATK/DEF, until the end of this turn. You can only use this effect of "Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss" once per turn. | You normally Summon Cherubini by using the Dracossack tokens, but don't forget that Havnis, King of the Swamp and Denier are also Level 3, and if you use them, you can keep the Dracossack effect to pop. Cherubini is mostly here to pitch King of the Swamp (or Havnis if you already have good targets in your GY). |
| 1 | ![Spright Sprind](/cards/sprind.jpg) | 2 monsters, including a Level/~~Rank~~/Link 2 monster. Cannot be used as Link Material the turn it is Link Summoned. You can only use 1 of the following effects of "Spright Sprind" per turn, and only once that turn. If this card is Link Summoned: You can send 1 Level 2 monster from your Deck to the GY. If another monster is Special Summoned while this card is on the field (except during the Damage Step): You can detach 1 material from an Xyz Monster you control, then target 1 monster on the field; return it to the hand. | Normally you make it with Dracossack and Cherubini, but if you can keep your Dracossack in board it is even better! Sprind is mostly here to pitch Merrli and fuse using the King of the Swamp that Cherubini pitched. |

### Visas package

| Quantity | Card | Effect | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | ![Visas Starfrost](/cards/visas.jpg) | If this card is in your hand: You can target 1 monster you control with a different Type and Attribute than this card; destroy that monster, and if you do, Special Summon this card. You can only use this effect of "Visas Starfrost" once per turn. When this card destroys an opponent's monster by battle: You can make this card gain ATK equal to half the original ATK or DEF of that monster (whichever is higher, your choice if tied). | This will also give your Heartbeat and Trivikarma an extra effect. Don't forget to trigger the GY effect of the monster you destroyed. |
| 1 | ![Vicious Astraloud](/cards/vicious.jpg) | "Visas Starfrost" + ~~1 monster with 1500 ATK/2100 DEF~~ "Tearlaments Reinoheart". Must be Special Summoned (from your Extra Deck) by banishing the above cards from your field and/or GY. Cannot be destroyed by battle. If this card is Special Summoned: You can target 1 other monster on the field; destroy it, and if you do, this card gains ATK equal to half of that monster's original ATK or DEF (whichever is higher). | You __can't__ use King of the Swamp nor Beasting of the Swamps to replace Visas Startfrost, since this is not a fusion but a contact fusion. This card is just a win-more, it's great to have on field. |

### The spice list

![Spicy cards](decks/spice.png)

## Sideboard

### Sideboard cards in your mainboard

In your mainboard I would recommend to have 3 to 6 cards going second. You can consider for example, Kaijus, Super Poly, TTT, Books, etc. Look at the [mainboard spicy cards section](#the-spice-list) for ideas.

### Sideboard cards in your sideboard

Counting the ones you have in your mainboard:

- 3 cards against towers (Super Poly or Kaijus).
- 2-3 backrow hate (Harpie's, Hearbeat, Shaddoll Dragon, Cosmic Cyclone, Twin Twisters, etc.).
- Graveyard hate is useful, but since we are playing Abyss Dweller as a core card, this is not mandatory (Called by, Belles).
- Cryme is good to have. It's a great going first card and can be searchable with Kaleido.
- If you are competitive, you'll need time cards (Gagaga Cowboy, Ladybug or Scattershot (if playing Sprind)).
- You will see Shekinaga in the Extra Deck in the following picture. It is there in case you want to play the small [Shaddol variant](#variant).

![Sideboard cards](decks/sideboard.png)

## Combos (videos)

### Dracossack - Cherubini - Sprind

With only Fenrir and a card to Special Summon TKash, you are able to send King of the Swamp and Merrli to the GY. Any other card you mill or you have in hand, are extenders.

<a href="https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=1000060-52664570" target="_blank">https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=1000060-52664570</a>

### Example of endboard with Beatrice and Winda

Ideally it can be bigger depending on your mills but the objective is simple: pitch Beast in your turn and make Winda in your opponent's turn.

<a href="https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=1000060-52619551" target="_blank">https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=1000060-52619551</a>

### Example of endboard with Cross-Sheep and Redoer

On your opponent's turn, you can fuse (with Sheiren). Put the fusion under Cross-Sheep. Then activate Sheep effect: revive Reino and continue...

<a href="https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=1000060-52665106" target="_blank">https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=1000060-52665106</a>

### Revolution combo

If you are playing the Revolution version, you can make a big board using only Fenrir and Revolution Synchron. In this case I was very lucky with all my follow-up and cards, but even without that Sheiren in hand I guarantee myself a Baronne and a mill 5 with TKash.

<a href="https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=1000060-52619657" target="_blank">https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=1000060-52619657</a>

### Shaddoll combo

The general idea is to take Schism with Apkallone and make the most useful fusion during your opponent's turn.

<a href="https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=1000060-52664963" target="_blank">https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=1000060-52664963</a>

### Shaddoll combo, how to make Baronne

The general idea is to use Cross-Shepp to revive Falco or Diviner, then make Baronne by using Construct or Granguignol.

<a href="https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=1000060-52664847" target="_blank">https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=1000060-52664847</a>

### Destrudo in GY combo

So, you normally want a Level 4 and a Level 7 on board. You target the Level 4 monster and Summon Destrudo as a Level 3. Then you make Baronne. If you are playing Synchro 7 monsters you can also target any Level 1-6 monster with Destrudo and Synchro Summon right away. For example:

- Target a Level 2 -> Destrudo becomes a Level 5 -> 2 + 5 = 7
- Target a Level 3 -> Destrudo becomes a Level 4 -> 3 + 4 = 7
- Target a Level 4 -> Destrudo becomes a Level 3 -> 4 + 3 = 7
- Target a Level 5 -> Destrudo becomes a Level 2 -> 5 + 2 = 7
- Target a Level 6 -> Destrudo becomes a Level 1 -> 6 + 1 = 7

## Test hands (videos)

### 1. Opponent Ashes my Fenrir

In this example, I have two choices:

- I keep Fenrir, set Book of Moon and pass.
- I gamble and make Guardian Chimera to mill 2 and draw 1 (in this case, it wasn't very good).

<a href="https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=1000060-52665159" target="_blank">https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=1000060-52665159</a>

### 2. Opponent Ashes my Sheiren

In this example I was lucky and had Poly, so I could make Guardian Chimera and continue. I also gambled when I chained CL1 Sheiren and CL2 Agido; if I would have hit nothing, I would have been obligated to fuse Sheiren + Guardian Chimera into Dragostapelia. Luckyly I hit a King of the Swamp. Also, I decided to make Grapha to get rid of my Trivikarma in hand, and also, I knew that I will have a Tear name online because I milled Sulliek (so I searched for TKash). Finally, I decided to get Metanoise, because I prefer to pitch a girl than to randomly mill 2.

<a href="https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=1000060-52665413" target="_blank">https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=1000060-52665413</a>

### 3. Simple test hand finishing on Fenrir + Toad + follow-up

<a href="https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=1000060-52665298" target="_blank">https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=1000060-52665298</a>

### 4. Okay board with the Synchron version

<a href="https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=1000060-52665534" target="_blank">https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=1000060-52665534</a>

## Example of endboard

The endboards will vary a lot depending on what you mill. Supposing your opponent has no interactions and you are going first, here are some examples of endboards you could have:

### Revolution

You could archieve this endboard with almost any version. In this case, you can see Amritara in the GY so we can assume that this is the Revolution version.

![Endboard Synchron](boards/vanilla.png)

### Shaddoll

In this version we have a full board of traps with Baronne, Rulkallos, Keldo as monster interactions. This is a very good endboard that will make Winda during your opponent's turn by banishing Merrli and Apkallone for example.

![Endboard Shaddoll](boards/shaddoll.png)

### Toad

Lots of interactions here too. Rulkallos protects Toad, and if your opponent tries to break throught the board, you have many interactions here too.

![Endboard Toad](boards/toad.png)

### Beatrice

This board is less powerful than the three others but is still very good. During your turn you dumped Shaddoll Beast with Beatrice, so now you will be able to make Winda by pitching a girl.

![Endboard Beatrice](boards/beatrice.png)

## Good targets to side out

Best cards to side out are cards that are dead in the matchup or flexible cards.

If you are going __first__ for example, you can side out your main deck going second cards (Kaijus (if you are playing Toad, consider on maybe keeping one Radian to make the frog), Super Poly, Books, etc.). If you still need room, you can side out some flex cards such as Terraforming, Foolish Burial Goods, Fenrir/Diviner (keep at least 1 main board), Wraitsoth, Scream (keep at least 2).

If you are going __second__ you can side out your Traps (keep only one Sulliek), Scream (keep at least 1 or 2), Terraforming, Foolish Burial Goods, Diviner, Wraitsoth, etc.

For the cards that __depend on the matchup__, here are some examples: if you are playing against Floo, side out all your Shaddoll cards and Mudora; if you are playing against a deck that doesn't need that much his GY like Kashtira, side out Mudora; etc.

## Chainblocking

### Chainblocking Belle

This also works with Skull Meister.

When you mill a girl and another card that has an effect when send to the GY (for example Shaddoll Beast), you can CL1 the girl and CL2 that other card to protect your effect that will fusion Summon from Ghost Belle.

### Chainblocking Ash

Protect your most important mill/search by putting it in CL1. For example, if you have a TKash mill and an Agido mill, put Agido in CL1 in case your opponent Ashes you because mill 5 > mill 2.

#### Chain order if you know your opponent has Ash and Imperm

If for example you have Scream in play and you Normal a Reino. Normally you would do: Cl1 Reino CL2 Scream. Reino is protected from Ash which is good.

BUT, imagine the scenario where they have Imperm too: Ash will negate Scream and Imperm will negate Reino. In this case, it's better to chainblock Scream with Reino, so Ash and Imperm can only negate him and Scream will resolve.

## Cards against Tear

Or if you are lucky make Baronne. You can also setup a strong backrow with one Tear name.<br /><br />For the continous Spell/Trap, you need to wish for a Fenrir or a way to make Baronne or Kaleido/Chimera using Polymerization. If you expect them to play it, side in some backrow hate. |

Once per turn (Quick Effect): You can detach 1 material from this card; your opponent cannot activate any card effects in their GY this turn. | Negate the the deck.

| ![Dimensional Barrier](/cards/dim-barrier.jpg) | Declare 1 monster card type (~~Ritual~~, Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, ~~or Pendulum~~); for the rest of this turn, neither player can Special Summon monsters of the declared type, also negate the effects of all monsters of that type while they are on the field. You can only activate 1 "Dimensional Barrier" per turn. | Call fusion.<br /><br />Kaleido and Rulkallos can't revive the turn you called fusion. Also, all their fusions will be negated. | Just make Redoer or Baronne. |
| ![Soul Drain](/cards/soul-drain.jpg) | Activate by paying 1000 LP. Monsters that are banished, as well as monsters in the GY, cannot activate their effects. | It's like a permanent Belle that can't be chainblocked. Be careful on time. | Wish for Fenrir or backrow hate. If you can make Baronne, or Kaleido/Chimera with Poly, this is also good. |

Also, don't forget that they can fuse with their set monsters. | You can always protect you with Toad or Baronne. Don't forget that you can use your face-down monsters for fusions. |

### Cards that hurt a bit

| Card(s) | Effect | Comment (as the player playing against Tear) | Comment (as the Tear player) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ![Droll](/cards/droll.jpg) | If a card(s) is added from the Main Deck to your opponent's hand, except during the Draw Phase (Quick Effect): You can send this card from your hand to the GY; for the rest of this turn, cards cannot be added from either player's Main Deck to the hand. | There are few cards that search in the deck, they can easily play around. | Few cards search in this deck: King of the Swamp, Terraforming, both Planets, Fenrir, Sulliek and Scream. Always respect Droll and play the most important one first (but be aware that you can get Ashed). |
| ![Effect Veiler](/cards/veiler.jpg) ![Ghost Mourner & Moonlit Chill](/cards/mourner.jpg) ![Infinite Impermanence](/cards/imperm.jpg) | During your opponent's Main Phase (Quick Effect): You can send this card from your hand to the GY, then target 1 Effect Monster your opponent controls; negate the effects of that face-up monster your opponent controls, until the end of this turn.<br /><br />If your opponent Special Summons a monster(s) face-up (except during the Damage Step): You can discard this card, then target 1 of those face-up monsters; negate its effects until the end of this turn, also if that face-up monster leaves the field this turn, its controller takes damage equal to its original ATK. You can only use this effect of "Ghost Mourner & Moonlit Chill" once per turn.<br /><br />Target 1 face-up monster your opponent controls; negate its effects (until the end of this turn), then, if this card was Set before activation and is on the field at resolution, for the rest of this turn all other Spell/Trap effects in this column are negated. If you control no cards, you can activate this card from your hand. | Negate an annoying monster on the field. If you have Imperm, I would keep it for Winda, Grapha, Toad or Baronne. | They can't negate Sheiren, Havnis nor TKash since the effect activates from hand and Veiler/Mourner/Imperm negate a monster in the field. But they can negate the fusions, Fenrir, Reino, Diviner or even the mill 3 of TKash. |
| ![Nibiru](/cards/nibiru.jpg) | During the Main Phase, if your opponent Normal or Special Summoned 5 or more monsters this turn (Quick Effect): You can Tribute as many face-up monsters on the field as possible, and if you do, Special Summon this card from your hand, then Special Summon 1 "Primal Being Token" (Rock/LIGHT/Level 11/ATK ?/DEF ?) to your opponent's field. (This Token's ATK/DEF become the combined original ATK/DEF of the Tributed monsters.) You can only use this effect of "Nibiru, the Primal Being" once per turn. | Try to use Nibiru before they Toad, Rullakllos, Grapha or Baronne | Try to put quickly on play Toad, Rullakllos, Grapha or Baronne. Don't forget that the token is a Light monster. It might be relevant to make Construct or as a Super Poly target. |
| ![Iblee](/cards/iblee.jpg) ![Conatct C](/cards/contact-c.jpg) | When this card is Normal Summoned: You can target 1 Link Monster in your GY; Special Summon it to your field so it points to this card, but change its ATK to 0, also negate its effects. You cannot Special Summon monsters, except Link Monsters. If this card in its owner's control is sent to the GY: You can Special Summon this card to your opponent's field in Defense Position. You can only use this effect of "Knightmare Corruptor Iblee" once per turn.<br /><br />When your opponent Normal or Special Summons a monster(s) (except during the Damage Step): You can Special Summon this card from your hand to the opponent's field in Defense Position. This card's controller cannot Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, or Link Summon unless they use this card as material. | If they don't respect them, you win, but you give them a free Sprind most of the time, so you are just helping them (if playing Iblee). | Just respect them and play a Link 2. Conatct C is also a Level 6, so you can make Beatrice with it. |
| ![Retaliating "C"](/cards/retaliating-c.jpg) | During either player's turn, when your opponent activates a Spell Card that includes an effect that Special Summons a monster(s): You can Special Summon this card from your hand. If Summoned this way, while this card is face-up on the field, any card sent to the Graveyard is banished instead. If this card is sent from the field to the Graveyard: You can add 1 EARTH Insect-Type monster with 1500 or less ATK from your Deck to your hand, except "Retaliating "C"". | Its useful when they play one of their Polys or Grief, but they don't do that every turn. So this could be a brick. | This would hurt when you play Grief, Polymerization, Super Poly or Shaddoll Fusion. Be careful when you play them. |
| ![Raigeki](/cards/raigeki.jpg) ![Dark Hole](/cards/dark-hole.jpg) ![Harpie's Feather Duster](/cards/harpies.jpg) ![Lighning Storm](/cards/lightning-storm.jpg) |  Destroy all monsters your opponent controls.<br /><br />Destroy all monsters on the field.<br /><br />Destroy all Spells and Traps your opponent controls.<br /><br />If you control no face-up cards: Activate 1 of these effects; ● Destroy all Attack Position monsters your opponent controls. ● Destroy all Spells and Traps your opponent controls. You can only activate 1 "Lightning Storm" per turn. | Be careful on what you destroy. You don't want to trigger they GY effects nescessarily. Also, don't forget that Rullkallos and Kaleido will revive (and Kaleido effect will trigger to spin and foolish). |  Hurts, but they will trigger your effects in the GY. Respect Lighning Storm by putting your monsters in defense. Some of them can be put in ATK if their ATK is bigger than their DEF like: Toad, Redoer, Grapha, TKash and Rullkallos. For Winda, always put it in ATK since she can't be destroyed by card effects. |

### Matchup specific

There are other matchup specific cards to be aware off, but this is not a topic for this guide. For example: Relinquished Anima, Vanquish Soul Razen/Pantera, Vaylantz World - Konig Wissen, etc.

### Floodgates

For all the floodgates, this deck plays quite well against them. Don't forget you can always pop them with Perlereino or banish them with Fenrir:

- Rivalry of the Warlords: this is like the best one here, but they can end up in a board with Kaleido and Grapha or even Rulkallos and Toad.
- Anti-Spell Fragrance: this one hurts, but they can still play around and set-up a crazy backrow.
- Skill Drain: their effects activate on the GY. Also, their monsters are super big because of the ATK modifiers of Perlereino and Scream.
- Gozen Match: their monsters are either Water or Dark, so they could technically have two boss monsters on play. Also, Reino is a Water and Grapha is Dark, so they can pitch a girl to make Grapha and have their backrow online with Reino.
- There Can Be Only One: their monsters have all different attributes, so this is not a problem. Fenrir/TKash are Psychic, Kaleido/Grapha are Fiends, Reino is a Warrior, the girls/Rulkallos/Toad are Aqua, Chimera is a Beast, Dragostapelia is a Plant, etc.
- Secret Village: Dharc, the Shaddolls and the Horus monsters are Spellcasters.

### Other tips vs Tear

- Don't forget that they play Guardian Chimera, so be careful of the Poly in GY.
- Dont forget that Metanoise, Hearbeat, Cryme and Grief recycle cards. Expect it.
- Always think that they can make Kaleido, Dragostapelia or Mudragon quite easily. Remove the cards that allow it.
- Always pop Perlereino, it's the only card that doesn't trigger when it goes to the GY.
- If they activate the effect of one of their Spell/Traps when sent to the GY, its the time to pop their backrow!
- Scream and Perlereino only modify ATK. Wraitsoth modifies ATK and DEF.
- Keep track where the girls are after they fuse. If you know two girls are in the bottom of the deck, try to see how they can shuffle their deck and try to counter it.

#### Small tips to know your opponent's hand

- If they search Reino or TKash with Perlereino is mostly because they have Sheiren in hand.
- If they search TKash with Perlereino is mostly because they have Reino and Sheiren in hand.
- If they search TKash with Wraitsoth is because they have Fenrir in hand.
- If they pitch Kelbek with Diviner is because they have Agido in hand.
- If they pitch Merrli over Havnis is because they have Merrli in hand **or** they don't play Spright Sprind.
